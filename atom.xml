Due to Google’s recent Android Security updates, <strong>Honor X7b  FRP Bypass</strong> is now extremely tough. FRP is a novel security mechanism implemented in contemporary Android smartphones. To authenticate the valid owner, Android will prompt you to input the last Google account active on the phone before executing the hard reset.</p><p>So, this tutorial is for you if you’ve lost your existing Gmail account and your smartphone is stopped at the Google verification screen. This guide will show you the most recent technique for **Honor X7b  FRP Bypass-**Google Account Unlock.

When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.</p><h3 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works?"></a>How it works?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you’ll need your phone’s Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we’ll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.</p><p>FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.</p><p>If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you’re in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.</p><p>Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.</p><p><strong>A simple list of solutions</strong></p><p>To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.</p><ul><li>Retrieve your Google account on another device</li><li>Delete Google account from Settings</li><li>Bypass Honor FRP through PC by using a USB Cable</li></ul><h2 id="Solutions-to-Bypass-Honor-FRP"><a href="#Solutions-to-Bypass-Honor-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?"></a>Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?</h2><h3 id="Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device"><a href="#Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device" class="headerlink" title="Retrieve your Google account on another device"></a>Retrieve your Google account on another device</h3><p>The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor X7b .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Honor FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Honor X7b  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Honor X7b  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.</p><p><strong>First step:</strong></p><p>To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Honor X7b  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor X7b . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor X7b , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Honor X7b device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Honor FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor X7b  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/realme-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="chrome"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Your file will be downloaded through the Chrome browser. Then install ES File Explorer so that you can find and open the apk file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/realme-frp-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="es file explorer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p><p>Once the ES File Explorer is installed on your phone, find the APK file downloaded to your device, and install it.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Honor X50 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does AddROM Really Work?"></a>Part 3. Does AddROM Really Work?</h2><p>The success rate of the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> can only be endorsed from the reviews of previous users. They can tell us if the users successfully bypass the FRP locks with this tool. From anecdotal research, we have discovered that some users could bypass the lock.</p><p>However, there were a lot of users who reported that they regained access to their phones.

Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Honor frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor X50 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor X50 device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Honor X50 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor X50 device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Honor X50 device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Honor X50 device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Honor X50 device. While using your Honor with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Honor-X50-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Honor-X50-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Honor X50 device Adequately"></a>Charging the Honor X50 device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-AddROM-APK" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Honor V Purse device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type “<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" >www.youtube.com/@addROMcom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ and click the “<strong>SEND WAP PUSH SL</strong> “ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png"                      alt="Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name."                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner. Click the “<strong>Brower sign-in</strong>“ option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.</p><p>After a restart, you won’t get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work"><a href="#Part-3-Does-AddROM-Really-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason.

This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone.

How to Download and Use AddROM APK?"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?</h2><p>You must be wondering how to download the <strong>AddROM bypass</strong> on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Honor Play 40C device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.</p><p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open your browser and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://addrom.com/bypass" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of AddROM. Scroll down and download the “ <strong>HushSMS.apk</strong>“ file. Then go to “<strong>My Files</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Downloads</strong> “ and find HushSMS.apk to install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png"                      alt="Download and install the HushSMS.apk file."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the app is installed, open it and click “<strong>WAP PUSH SL.</strong>“ Then enter the phone number of the locked device.

Click the “<strong>Menu</strong>“ icon at the top right corner and select “Terms &amp; Privacy Policies.”</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After clicking Terms &amp; Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type “<strong>addrom.com&#x2F;bypass,</strong>“ scroll down, and then download the relevant “<strong>Google Account Manager</strong> “ (GAM) APK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png"                      alt="Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK."                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you are supposed to download the “ <strong>FRP bypass APK</strong>“ file from the list.

Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.</p><p>Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don’t know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.</p><p>However, in most cases, users don’t remember their Google ID and password. This is where <strong><strong>AddROM</strong> Bypass</strong> steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.</p><p>But before starting, let’s learn about <strong>AddROM</strong>!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AddROM"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AddROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AddROM?"></a>Part 1. What is AddROM?</h2><p><strong>AddROM</strong> is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.</p><p>However, the good thing about this tool is that you don’t need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the <strong>AddROM APK</strong> file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png"                      alt="Official logo of addROM."                ></p><p>But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article.

When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.</p><h3 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works?"></a>How it works?</h3><p>Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you’ll need your phone’s Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we’ll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.</p><p>FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.</p><p>If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you’re in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone.

You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor Magic 6 Pro .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Honor FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize.

You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Honor Magic 6 Pro  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor Magic 6 Pro . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor Magic 6 Pro , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Honor Magic 6 Pro device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Honor FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor Magic 6 Pro  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone.

If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme V30T device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings.

The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Realme V30T Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme V30T device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme V30T device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme V30T phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-V30T-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-V30T-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Realme frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Realme 12 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Realme 12 5G device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Realme 12 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Realme 12 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Realme 12 5G device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Realme 12 5G device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass"></a>Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass</h2><p>It is crucial to make sure you’re prepared before you go after the <strong>Realme FRP bypass the Android 13</strong>. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let’s get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.</p><h3 id="Ensuring-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#Ensuring-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Ensuring Device Compatibility"></a>Ensuring Device Compatibility</h3><p>First, verify that your Realme smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.</p><h3 id="Backup-Important-Data"><a href="#Backup-Important-Data" class="headerlink" title="Backup Important Data"></a>Backup Important Data</h3><p>Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Realme before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Realme 12 5G device. While using your Realme with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Realme-12-5G-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Realme-12-5G-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Realme 12 5G device Adequately"></a>Charging the Realme 12 5G device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Realme device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.</p><h3 id="Connecting-to-Stable-Internet"><a href="#Connecting-to-Stable-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Connecting to Stable Internet"></a>Connecting to Stable Internet</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you’ll avoid potential delays or complications.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Method-1-Using-Official-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account"></a>Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account</h2><p>The FRP lock on your Realme smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 11 Pro FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes.

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="what is Poco frp"                ></p><h3 id="Working-of-FRP"><a href="#Working-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Working of FRP"></a>Working of FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Poco X6 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Poco X6 device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Poco X6 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Poco X6 device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Poco X6 device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Poco X6 device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

While using your Poco with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.</p><h3 id="Charging-the-Poco-X6-device-Adequately"><a href="#Charging-the-Poco-X6-device-Adequately" class="headerlink" title="Charging the Poco X6 device Adequately"></a>Charging the Poco X6 device Adequately</h3><p>Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process.
