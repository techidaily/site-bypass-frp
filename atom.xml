In recent days Honor 90 GT has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor 90 GT device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor 90 GT. It is designed to safeguard the Honor 90 GT device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor 90 GT FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-90-GT-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-90-GT-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor 90 GT FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor 90 GT FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor 90 GT FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor 90 GT FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor 90 GT:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor 90 GT frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-90-GT-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-90-GT-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor 90 GT FRP?"></a>What is Honor 90 GT FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 90 GT by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 90 GT device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 90 GT device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 90 GT device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-90-GT-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-90-GT-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor 90 GT FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor 90 GT FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor 90 GT FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 90 GT device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 90 GT device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 90 GT device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-90-GT-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-90-GT-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor 90 GT FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor 90 GT FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 90 GT device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 90 GT after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 90 GT device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-90-GT-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-90-GT-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor 90 GT FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor 90 GT FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 90 GT device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 90 GT device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 90 GT phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.

How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?</h3><p>Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:</p><ul><li>When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.</li><li>Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor 90 GT device.</li></ul><p>These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials.

It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 Lite by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 Lite device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 Lite device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 6 Lite device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 6 Lite device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic 6 Lite device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic 6 Lite after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 Lite device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-6-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.</p><p>The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Honor Magic 6 Lite users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Honor Magic 6 Lite:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> To start, turn on your Honor Magic 6 Lite and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Honor Magic 6 Lite device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-4.jpg"                      alt="add sim to tecno pop 5"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap “Emergency,” where the Honor Magic 6 Lite device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-5.jpg"                      alt="provide sim passcode"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After pressing “Emergency,” tap “Emergency Information” on the next screen.

It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device.</p><p>The <strong><strong>Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro FRP code</strong></strong> serves as a protective barrier.

Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers.

It ties your Google account to the Realme Narzo 60x 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme Narzo 60x 5G device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area.

In recent days Honor Magic V2 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor Magic V2 device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor Magic V2. It is designed to safeguard the Honor Magic V2 device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor Magic V2 FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor Magic V2 FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor Magic V2 FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor Magic V2 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor Magic V2 FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor Magic V2:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor Magic V2 frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor Magic V2 FRP?"></a>What is Honor Magic V2 FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic V2 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic V2 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic V2 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic V2 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Magic V2 FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Magic V2 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Magic V2 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic V2 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic V2 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic V2 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor Magic V2 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor Magic V2 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic V2 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic V2 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic V2 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-V2-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic V2 FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic V2 FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 11X 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11X-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-11X-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11X 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11X 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme 11X 5G</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

In recent days Honor Play 40C has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor Play 40C device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor Play 40C. It is designed to safeguard the Honor Play 40C device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor Play 40C FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor Play 40C FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor Play 40C FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor Play 40C FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor Play 40C:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor Play 40C frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor Play 40C FRP?"></a>What is Honor Play 40C FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Play 40C by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Play 40C device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Play 40C device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Play 40C device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Play 40C device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Play 40C device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Play 40C device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor Play 40C FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Play 40C device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Play 40C after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Play 40C device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Play 40C device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Play 40C device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Play 40C phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Play-40C-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Play-40C-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It ties your Google account to the Realme 12 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Realme 12 5G device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful.
