But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme C67 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-C67-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-C67-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme C67 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme C67 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor X9b FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-X9b-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-X9b-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor X9b FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor X9b FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor X9b FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor X9b FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free.

It is also included on the Honor X9b by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X9b device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X9b device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X9b device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-X9b-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-X9b-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor X9b FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor X9b FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor X9b FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X9b device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X9b device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X9b device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X9b-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X9b-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor X9b FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor X9b FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X9b device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X9b after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X9b device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-X9b-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-X9b-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X9b FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X9b FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-80-Pro-Straight-Screen-Edition-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

It is also included on the Honor Magic 5 Lite by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 5 Lite device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 5 Lite device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 5 Lite device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic 5 Lite device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic 5 Lite after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic 5 Lite device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor Magic 5 Pro FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor Magic 5 Pro</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device.</p><p>After a factory reset, the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device. This prevents someone who doesn’t know the account details from gaining access to the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device.</p><h3 id="Significance-of-FRP"><a href="#Significance-of-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Significance of FRP"></a>Significance of FRP</h3><p>FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p><p>By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device’s security measures.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass"><a href="#Part-2-Preparing-for-FRP-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor X8b device and the system.</p><p>This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X8b device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.</p><p>As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor X8b device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.

This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.</p><p>Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.</p><p><strong>A simple list of solutions</strong></p><p>To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.</p><ul><li>Retrieve your Google account on another device</li><li>Delete Google account from Settings</li><li>Bypass Honor FRP through PC by using a USB Cable</li></ul><h2 id="Solutions-to-Bypass-Honor-FRP"><a href="#Solutions-to-Bypass-Honor-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?"></a>Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?</h2><h3 id="Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device"><a href="#Retrieve-your-Google-account-on-another-device" class="headerlink" title="Retrieve your Google account on another device"></a>Retrieve your Google account on another device</h3><p>The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor X8b .</p><p>You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification <strong>Honor FRP bypass code,</strong> which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.</p><p>Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you’ve synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.</p><p>If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Honor X8b  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.</p><p><strong>Delete Google account from Settings</strong></p><p>Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Honor X8b  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.</p><p><strong>First step:</strong></p><p>To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.</p><p><strong>Second step:</strong></p><p>We browse through the C11 options and seek for the “Accounts” area, where you have to click to enable.</p><p><strong>Third step:</strong></p><p>All accounts associated with this Honor X8b  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.</p><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong></p><p>It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor X8b . To proceed, click “Remove account.”</p><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong></p><p>To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor X8b , tap “Remove account” once more to verify. It will clear the Honor X8b device of any data associated with this account.</p><p><strong>Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable</strong></p><p>If you want to use your PC to bypass Honor FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor X8b  with your PC by using a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 12 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme 12 5G</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme 12 5G device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme 12 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme 12 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-5G-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Realme-12-5G-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="pixel frp"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP"><a href="#Part-3-Can-factory-reset-really-remove-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?"></a>Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?</h2><p>To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor Magic 5 Lite</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic5-Ultimate-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic5-Ultimate-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor Magic5 Ultimate</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account.

The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device.</p><p>The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Honor-phone"><a href="#Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Honor phone"></a>Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Honor phone</h2><p>Although the factory reset protection program and the lock are beneficial to keep your device safe from other people’s hands, sometimes it can cause problems for you also.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Poco C50 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Poco C50 device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>The Pangu FRP Bypass boasts extensive compatibility with several Android brands, covering:</p><ul><li>Samsung</li><li>Lenovo</li><li>LG</li><li>Oppo</li><li>HTC</li><li>Micromax</li><li>Vivo, and more</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-03.jpg"                      alt="android smartphone logo"                ></p><p>Different devices and Android OS versions may have varying compatibility within each brand.

But there are reasons to consider other options. Let’s explore them.</p><p>Technical Knowledge Required</p><p>It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you’re not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It’s not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.</p><p>Limited Customer Support</p><p>Thetooldoesn’t provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.</p><p>Limited Compatibility</p><p><strong>Pangu FRP bypass</strong> is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg"                      alt="otg for android phone"                ></p><p>Safety Concerns</p><p>Some <strong>Pangu FRP bypass APK</strong> versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-Magic-5-Lite-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor Magic 5 Lite</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme Narzo 60 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Narzo-60-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-Narzo-60-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Narzo 60 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme Narzo 60 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme Narzo 60 5G</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.
