It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 Pro device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset.

It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-6-Pro-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Magic-6-Pro-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

It ties your Google account to the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version.

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of bypassing Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ FRP.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 12+ 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12+ 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12+ 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Realme-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Realme Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Realme 12+ 5G</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Realme users to bypass FRP on any Realme brand.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Honor 100 Pro device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Honor 100 Pro device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful.
