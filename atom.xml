It will make the process of the <strong>Honor Play 40C FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor Play 40C:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor Play 40C frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor Play 40C FRP?"></a>What is Honor Play 40C FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Play 40C by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Play 40C device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Play 40C device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Play 40C device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Play 40C device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Play 40C device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Play 40C device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor Play 40C FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Play 40C after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Play 40C device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Play-40C-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-Play-40C-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Play 40C device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Play 40C device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Play 40C phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Play-40C-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-Play-40C-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Honor 100 Pro device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Honor 100 Pro device’s system and bypass the FRP lock.</p><p>Is It Legal?</p><p>The legality of using the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass</strong> remains a gray area. While it’s not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Supported-Brands-for-the-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>The Pangu FRP Bypass boasts extensive compatibility with several Android brands, covering:</p><ul><li>Samsung</li><li>Lenovo</li><li>LG</li><li>Oppo</li><li>HTC</li><li>Micromax</li><li>Vivo, and more</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-03.jpg"                      alt="android smartphone logo"                ></p><p>Different devices and Android OS versions may have varying compatibility within each brand.

When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme V30 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier.

FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme V30 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Realme-V30-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Realme-V30-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Realme V30 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Realme V30 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of bypassing Realme C33 2023 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Some-Common-Reasons-To-Bypass-Realme-C33-2023-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Some-Common-Reasons-To-Bypass-Realme-C33-2023-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Realme C33 2023 FRP"></a>Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Realme C33 2023 FRP</h2><p>Realme C33 2023 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:</p><h3 id="1-Forgotten-Google-Account-Credentials"><a href="#1-Forgotten-Google-Account-Credentials" class="headerlink" title="1. Forgotten Google Account Credentials"></a>1. Forgotten Google Account Credentials</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you’ve had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there’s always a chance that you might forget your password.</p><h3 id="2-A-Second-Hand-Phone"><a href="#2-A-Second-Hand-Phone" class="headerlink" title="2. A Second-Hand Phone"></a>2. A Second-Hand Phone</h3><p>Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you’ve purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn’t correctly remove their Google account from the Realme C33 2023 device before selling it to you, then you’ll be stuck with their account on the phone and won’t be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.</p><h3 id="3-Factory-Reset-In-An-Untrusted-Environment"><a href="#3-Factory-Reset-In-An-Untrusted-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment"></a>3.

It is also included on the Honor X50 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X50 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X50 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X50 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-X50-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-X50-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor X50 FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor X50 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor X50 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X50 device.

FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X50 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X50-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X50-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor X50 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor X50 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-Pro-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-12-Pro-5G-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes.

In recent days Honor X50i+ has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor X50i+ device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor X50i+. It is designed to safeguard the Honor X50i+ device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Honor X50i+ FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-X50i-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Honor-X50i-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Honor X50i+ FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Honor X50i+ FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor X50i+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Honor X50i+ FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor X50i+:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Honor X50i+ frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Honor-X50i-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Honor-X50i-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Honor X50i+ FRP?"></a>What is Honor X50i+ FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X50i+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X50i+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X50i+ device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X50i+ device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Honor-X50i-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Honor-X50i-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Honor X50i+ FRP"></a>Purpose of Honor X50i+ FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Honor X50i+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X50i+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X50i+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X50i+ device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X50i-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Honor-X50i-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Honor X50i+ FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Honor X50i+ FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X50i+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X50i+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X50i+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-X50i-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Honor-X50i-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X50i+ FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X50i+ FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Honor Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html" >FRP bypass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.</li><li><strong>Warranty Void:</strong> Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor X50i+ is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.</li><li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.</li></ol><h3 id="2-Required-Tools-and-Equipment"><a href="#2-Required-Tools-and-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="2. Required Tools and Equipment"></a>2.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Honor 100 Pro FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Honor FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-100-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Honor-100-Pro-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor 100 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor 100 Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Honor FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Honor-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP.</em></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-FRP-on-Honor-Android-11-without-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC</h2><p>Now that you have all the reasons to bypass <strong>FRP on Honor 100 Pro</strong> or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. <a class="link"   href="https://www.technocareapk.com/" >TechnoCare APK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an Android software that allows Honor users to bypass FRP on any Honor brand.

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor 100 Pro smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for <strong>Honor 100 Pro Nord FRP bypass</strong> solutions for seamless device access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp bypass in oneplus phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Google-FRP-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 100 Pro device’s data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.</p><p>If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 100 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 100 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-100-Pro-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Google-FRP-Lock-on-Any-Honor-100-Pro-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

In recent days Realme C51 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Realme C51 device’s impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Realme C51. It is designed to safeguard the Realme C51 device from unauthorized access.</p><p>While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the <strong>Realme C51 FRP</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-the-Realme-C51-FRP"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-the-Realme-C51-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Understanding the Realme C51 FRP"></a>Part 1: Understanding the Realme C51 FRP</h2><p>Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme C51 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the <strong>Realme C51 FRP bypass</strong> easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme C51:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="bypass Realme C51 frp lock"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-Realme-C51-FRP"><a href="#What-is-Realme-C51-FRP" class="headerlink" title="What is Realme C51 FRP?"></a>What is Realme C51 FRP?</h3><p>FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme C51 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme C51 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme C51 device to the user’s Google account.</p><p>That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme C51 device.</p><h3 id="Purpose-of-Realme-C51-FRP"><a href="#Purpose-of-Realme-C51-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Realme C51 FRP"></a>Purpose of Realme C51 FRP</h3><p>The primary purpose of Realme C51 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme C51 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme C51 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme C51 device’s contents. It does that by requiring the original owner’s Google account login details.</p><p>By requiring the user’s Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.</p><h3 id="Activation-Methods-of-Realme-C51-FRP"><a href="#Activation-Methods-of-Realme-C51-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Activation Methods of Realme C51 FRP"></a>Activation Methods of Realme C51 FRP</h3><p>When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme C51 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme C51 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.</p><p>In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme C51 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Realme-C51-FRP"><a href="#Part-2-Preparations-Before-Bypassing-Realme-C51-FRP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme C51 FRP"></a>Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Realme C51 FRP</h2><p>Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>Realme Y12 FRP bypass</strong>, it’s time to prepare for the bypassing process.

But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few <strong>Realme C51 FRP</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective <strong>Realme FRP bypass</strong> methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-C51-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-C51-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme C51 FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme C51 FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone.

I hope this helps!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-itel-s23pluswithwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Itel S23+with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-itel-a60-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass Itel A60 FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-bypass-realme-narzo-n55-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Bypass Realme Narzo N55 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-honor-magic-5-pro-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easy Guide to Honor Magic 5 Pro FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-vivo-y100a-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass Vivo Y100A FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-vivo-x-fold-2-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Bypass Vivo X Fold 2 FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-honor-x9b-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Bypass Honor X9b FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-frp-from-zte-blade-a73-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass FRP from ZTE Blade A73 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/latest-guide-how-to-bypass-infinix-note-30-frp-without-computer-by-drfone-android/"><u>Latest Guide How To Bypass Infinix Note 30 FRP Without Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/high-def-gaming-gpu-recommendations-for-2024/"><u>High-Def Gaming GPU Recommendations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-efficient-ways-to-clean-your-youtube-watch-later-playlist/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Efficient Ways to Clean Your YouTube Watch Later Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-setup-guide-for-effective-after-effects-texting/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Setup Guide for Effective After Effects Texting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-11-pro-max-to-other-iphone-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From iPhone 11 Pro Max To Other iPhone devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-viral-tiktok-with-these-best-captions/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Secrets to Viral TikTok with These Best Captions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-analyzing-instagrams-per-video-timeframe/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Analyzing Instagram's Per-Video Timeframe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-enhancing-your-discord-talk-with-no-cost-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Your Discord Talk with No-Cost Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-capture-techniques-for-your-lenovo-screen/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Quick Capture Techniques for Your Lenovo Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-did-your-apple-iphone-15-passcode-change-itself-unlock-it-now-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Did Your Apple iPhone 15 Passcode Change Itself?
