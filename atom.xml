Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.</p><ul><li>You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.</li><li>Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.</li><li>You can permanently delete the Google account.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30T-FRP-Bypass-Android-11"><a href="#Part-1-What-Will-You-Get-After-Realme-V30T-FRP-Bypass-Android-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30T FRP Bypass Android 11?"></a>Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme V30T FRP Bypass Android 11?</h2><p>FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.</p><p><em><strong>Important note</strong>: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone.

Please help.” A user says so on Quora.</p><p>In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Realme  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these <strong>FRP bypass Realme</strong> tools.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.</p><p>You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.</p><ul><li>You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.</li><li>Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.</li><li>You can permanently delete the Google account.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Realme smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Realme GT 5 device and the system.</p><p>This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Realme GT 5 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.</p><p>As a result, the user cannot restore the Realme GT 5 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Realme GT 5 device.</p><p>The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Realme. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Realme GT 5 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Realme-phone"><a href="#Part-2-8-Ways-to-bypass-Google-locks-on-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Realme phone"></a>Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Realme phone</h2><p>Although the factory reset protection program and the lock are beneficial to keep your device safe from other people’s hands, sometimes it can cause problems for you also.

Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.</p><ul><li>You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.</li><li>Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.</li><li>You can permanently delete the Google account.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Google-Lock-on-Realme-Without-Computer-30-Min-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

But there are reasons to consider other options. Let’s explore them.</p><p>Technical Knowledge Required</p><p>It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you’re not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It’s not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.</p><p>Limited Customer Support</p><p>Thetooldoesn’t provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.</p><p>Limited Compatibility</p><p><strong>Pangu FRP bypass</strong> is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg"                      alt="otg for android phone"                ></p><p>Safety Concerns</p><p>Some <strong>Pangu FRP bypass APK</strong> versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn’t always the case, it’s crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.</p><p>Low Success Rate</p><p>While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn’t guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn’t work on your device. Choosing other <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html"><u> FRP bypass software</u></a> with a higher success rate can save you time.</p><p>Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills.

But there are reasons to consider other options. Let’s explore them.</p><p>Technical Knowledge Required</p><p>It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you’re not tech-savvy.

FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.</p><p>The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/"><u>factory reset</u></a> in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won’t be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.</p><p>Then are you curious about the safety of the <strong>Pangu FRP bypass tool</strong>? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we’ll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg"                      alt="google frp lock on android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Pangu-FRP-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?"></a>Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?</h2><p>FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Realme 12 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.</p><p><strong>The Pangu FRP Bypass tool</strong> aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.</p><p>The tool can be helpful in situations where you:</p><ul><li><strong>Forgot your Google account credentials</strong></li></ul><p>If you can’t remember your Google account password, <strong>Pangu FRP unlocker</strong> can help you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html"><u>bypass the verification</u></a> and access your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Bought a used phone</strong></li></ul><p>If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner’s Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.</p><ul><li><strong>Need to reset your phone but don’t want to lose access</strong></li></ul><p>If you need to factory reset your phone but don’t want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg"                      alt="reset android phone settings"                ></p><p>How Does It Work?</p><p>There are two main versions of <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass tools</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong></li></ul><p>This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the <strong>Pangu FRP Bypass APK</strong> removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC</strong></li></ul><p>This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version.

But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass <strong>Realme FRP</strong>. Here are some of them:</p><h4 id="You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone"><a href="#You’re-the-new-owner-and-get-whole-control-of-your-Realme-phone" class="headerlink" title="You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone"></a>You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone</h4><p>Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.</p><h4 id="Remove-viruses-and-malware"><a href="#Remove-viruses-and-malware" class="headerlink" title="Remove viruses and malware"></a>Remove viruses and malware</h4><p>Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.</p><h4 id="Increase-the-resale-value"><a href="#Increase-the-resale-value" class="headerlink" title="Increase the resale value"></a>Increase the resale value</h4><p>Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces.
