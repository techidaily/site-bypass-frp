### Purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 70 Lite 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 70 Lite 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 70 Lite 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 70 Lite 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Honor 70 Lite 5G and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Honor 70 Lite 5G to your computer.

### 4\. Ensure a Stable Internet Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is vital for a smooth FRP bypass. Make sure your computer and Honor 70 Lite 5G are connected to the internet throughout the process. FRP bypassing will need you to download related files to complete the procedure.
