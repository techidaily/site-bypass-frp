## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 90 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor 90 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor 90 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Honor 90 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Honor 90 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor 90 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor 90 FRP bypass.

## Part 2: Definition of Honor 90  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

![pixel frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/google-pixel-frp-bypass-4.jpg)
