How and why should I bypass Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

### 3\. The person with a Honor from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.
