### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor Play 7T FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor Play 7T FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Honor from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.
