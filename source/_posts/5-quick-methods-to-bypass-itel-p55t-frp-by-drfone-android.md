## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Itel P55T FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Itel P55T FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Itel P55T FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Itel P55T FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Itel P55T FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Itel P55T FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Itel?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Itel P55T device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Itel smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Itel P55T device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Itel P55T device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Itel P55T device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Itel P55T device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Itel. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Itel P55T device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
