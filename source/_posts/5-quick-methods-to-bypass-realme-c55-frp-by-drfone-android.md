## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Realme C55 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Realme C55 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Realme C55 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Realme C55 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Realme C55 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Realme

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Realme phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Realme C55 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Realme phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Realme C55 FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Realme from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.

## Part 1: Understanding the Realme C55 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Realme C55 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Realme C55 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Realme C55:

![bypass Realme C55 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme C55 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme C55 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme C55 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme C55 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme C55 device.

### Purpose of Realme C55 FRP

The primary purpose of Realme C55 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme C55 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme C55 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme C55 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme C55 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme C55 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme C55 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme C55 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 3: Realme C55 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Realme C55 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Realme C55 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Realme Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)
