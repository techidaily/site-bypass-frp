## Part 1: In what cases does the Tecno Spark 20 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Tecno Spark 20 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Tecno

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Tecno phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Tecno Spark 20 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Tecno phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Tecno Spark 20 FRP bypass.

### What is Tecno Spark 20 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 20 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark 20 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark 20 device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark 20 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark 20 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark 20 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Tecno Spark 20 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Tecno Spark 20 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Tecno Spark 20 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Tecno Spark 20 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Tecno Spark 20 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.
