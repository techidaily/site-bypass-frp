### What is Vivo X Flip FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo X Flip by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo X Flip device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo X Flip device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo X Flip device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Vivo X Flip FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo X Flip FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo X Flip device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo X Flip device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo X Flip device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo X Flip FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo X Flip device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo X Flip after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo X Flip device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
