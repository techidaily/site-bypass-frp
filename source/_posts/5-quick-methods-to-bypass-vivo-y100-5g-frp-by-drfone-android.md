## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Vivo Y100 5G FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Vivo Y100 5G FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Vivo tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Vivo smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Vivo Y100 5G FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Vivo Y100 5G FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
