## Part 2: Definition of Vivo Y100 5G  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher.

When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

To regain full access to the Vivo Y100 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y100 5G device.

The ****Vivo Y100 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y100 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y100 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y100 5G device. In essence, the Vivo Y100 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
