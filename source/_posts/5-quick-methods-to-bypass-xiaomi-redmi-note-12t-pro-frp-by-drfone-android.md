### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Xiaomi Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.
