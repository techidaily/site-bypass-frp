### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Google Pixel 8 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Google  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.
