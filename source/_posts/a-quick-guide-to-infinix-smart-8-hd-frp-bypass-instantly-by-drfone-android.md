### What is Infinix Smart 8 HD FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 HD by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 HD device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 HD device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 8 HD device.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 8 HD FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 8 HD FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 8 HD device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 8 HD device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 8 HD device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 8 HD after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 HD device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
