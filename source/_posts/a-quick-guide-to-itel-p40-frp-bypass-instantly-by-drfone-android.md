**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Itel P40  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Itel P40 . To proceed, click "Remove account."

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Itel phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Itel P40 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Itel FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Itel phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Itel P40 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Itel FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Itel phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Itel phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Itel FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Itel phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on Itel P40** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows Itel users to bypass FRP on any Itel brand.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Itel Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten.

It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Itel, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Itel

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Itel Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Itel and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
