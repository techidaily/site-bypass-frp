## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How To Bypass Itel P55 5G FRP

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Itel P55 5G has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Itel P55 5G device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Itel P55 5G. It is designed to safeguard the Itel P55 5G device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Itel P55 5G FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel P55 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel P55 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel P55 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel P55 5G:

![bypass Itel P55 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Itel P55 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P55 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P55 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P55 5G device.

### Purpose of Itel P55 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P55 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P55 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P55 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P55 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P55 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P55 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P55 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P55 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
