### What is Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco M6 Pro 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco M6 Pro 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.

### Purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco M6 Pro 4G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco M6 Pro 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco M6 Pro 4G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Poco Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Poco M6 Pro 4G is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Poco M6 Pro 4G to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data
