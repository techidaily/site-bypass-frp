### What is Realme 11 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 11 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 11 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 11 5G device to the user's Google account.
