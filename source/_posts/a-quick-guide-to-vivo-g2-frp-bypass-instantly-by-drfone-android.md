## Part 1: What‚Äôs Vivo G2 FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo G2 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo G2 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo G2 device.

The ****Vivo G2 FRP code****¬†serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo G2 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo G2 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo G2 device. In essence, the Vivo G2 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

#### Complete the Setup

But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let‚Äôs move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Vivo G2 device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

![Download and install the HushSMS.apk file.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png)
