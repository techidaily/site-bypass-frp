Since many Vivo S17e users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo S17e device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
