Since many Vivo Y100A users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Vivo Y100A device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Vivo Y100A smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Vivo Y100A FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y100A device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

## Part 1: What is Vivo FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn't allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the **Vivo FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English **Vivo FRP** **code** is \*#813#, and the Chinese code is \*#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.
