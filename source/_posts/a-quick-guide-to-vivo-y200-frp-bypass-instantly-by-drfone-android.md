Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Vivo Y200 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y200 device.

The ****Vivo Y200 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y200 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y200 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y200 device. In essence, the Vivo Y200 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo Y200 device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html)possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

- Bypassing the FRP lock screen with this tool could risk your data and privacy. It can expose your data to vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of legal restrictions surrounding the use of **AddROM**. Make sure it is allowed in your jurisdiction to avoid legal consequences.
- Successfully using AddROM requires technical knowledge. Improper use may lead to device malfunction or data loss.
- Research feedback from other users who have used this tool to bypass FRP locks. It can help you to understand potential risks and benefits.

## Conclusion
