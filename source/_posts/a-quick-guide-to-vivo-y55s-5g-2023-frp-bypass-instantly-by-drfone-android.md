Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Vivo smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device and the system.
