In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Infinix Hot 40i FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Hot 40i FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Hot 40i FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Hot 40i FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Hot 40i:

![bypass Infinix Hot 40i frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Hot 40i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Hot 40i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Hot 40i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Hot 40i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Hot 40i device.

### Purpose of Infinix Hot 40i FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Hot 40i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Hot 40i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Hot 40i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Hot 40i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Hot 40i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Hot 40i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Hot 40i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Hot 40i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.
