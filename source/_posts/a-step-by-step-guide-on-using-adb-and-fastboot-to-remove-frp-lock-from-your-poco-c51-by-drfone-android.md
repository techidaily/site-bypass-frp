### 5\. How to disable Poco security?

Disabling security features like passwords, PINs, pattern locks, or biometric scans can be done through settings:

- **Step 1.** Open 'Settings' and go to 'Security'.
- **Step 2.** Tap on 'Passcode', 'Biometrics & Passcode', or a similar option depending on your device model.
- **Step 3.** Choose the lock method currently in use and select 'None' or 'Disable'.

**Note:** Disabling security features makes your device more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
