### What is Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme GT Neo 5 SE by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device.

### Purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP

The primary purpose of Realme GT Neo 5 SE FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
