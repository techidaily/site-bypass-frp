## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y27s FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y27s device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo Y27s device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y27s device.

The ****Vivo Y27s FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y27s device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y27s device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y27s device. In essence, the Vivo Y27s FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo Y27s device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo Y27s device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo Y27s device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Vivo FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Vivo .

## Part 1: What is Vivo FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone.

You can enter the **Vivo FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.
