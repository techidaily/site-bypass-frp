#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Xiaomi smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Xiaomi phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Xiaomi smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
