Several issues can be resolved, and multiple functions can be performed using the **ADB format tool** and Fastboots, and this also includes removing the FRP lock on your Android device. To use this method, USB debugging should be enabled on the Honor Magic 6 device.

For specific brands of Android phones, specific utility tools are available like the **Vivo ADB format tool** and the **Samsung ADB format tool**, which are used explicitly for Vivo and Samsung phones, respectively.

### 2\. How Do ADB and Fastboot Bypass FRP?

Using the versatile ADB command-line tool and Fastboots, the Google FRP lock can be removed using several commands depending on the OS version.

ADB comes included in the Android SDK Platform-Tools package, and this can be downloaded using the SDK manager.

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor Magic 6 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor Magic 6 FRP bypass.
