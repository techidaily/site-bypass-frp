- Step 3. Access Emergency Call and Enable USB Debugging

After downloading the necessary drivers, power off your smartphone and connect it to the computer. Press the "Volume Up" and "Volume Down" buttons simultaneously for almost 3 seconds as it connects. This initiates the FRP unlocking process. If everything went smoothly with the unlocking, click "Done."
