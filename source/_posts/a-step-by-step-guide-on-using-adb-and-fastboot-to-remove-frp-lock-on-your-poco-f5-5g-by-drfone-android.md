## Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco F5 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Poco FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Poco

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Poco Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Poco and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
