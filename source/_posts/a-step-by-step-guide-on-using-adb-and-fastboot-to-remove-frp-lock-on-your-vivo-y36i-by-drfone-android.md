## Part 2: Vivo Y36i FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Vivo Y36i Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Vivo Y36i users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Vivo Y36i:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Vivo Y36i and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Vivo Y36i device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Vivo Y36i device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

- **Step 3.** After pressing "Emergency," tap "Emergency Information" on the next screen. On the "Owner" screen, tap the icon at the top right corner, enter the SIM PIN code, and when asked, choose "Add contact."
