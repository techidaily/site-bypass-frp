This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Xiaomi. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
