Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Poco C65 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Poco C65 device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Poco C65. It is designed to safeguard the Poco C65 device from unauthorized access.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Poco C65 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Poco C65 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco C65 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Poco C65 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco C65:

![bypass Poco C65 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco C65 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C65 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C65 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C65 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco C65 device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Poco C65 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco C65 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco C65 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C65 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco C65 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Poco C65 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco C65 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco C65 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco C65 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
