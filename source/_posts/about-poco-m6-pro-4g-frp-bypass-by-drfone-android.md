FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Poco FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Poco Android 11 without PC

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on Poco M6 Pro 4G** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows Poco users to bypass FRP on any Poco brand. It's straightforward; this app lets you create another Google Account on your locked Poco phone without unlocking it. In short, you'll link a new Google Account with a password that you can easily remember.

#### TechnoCare APK Features

- Safe and straightforward Android APK.
- Install custom ROMs on Poco.
- No registration is required.
- No age restrictions to use.
- User-friendly and quick FRP unlock.

#### Steps to bypass Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP with TechnoCare APK

- **Step 1:** Start by enabling the Talkback feature on your phone. To do that, tap the Home key three times consecutively on the welcome screen.
- **Step 2:** Now go to the Talkback Menu and then open Talkback Settings. Then, click the Search icon and enter “Getting started with Talkback.”
- **Step 3:** Play the video on the “Getting Started” screen. Then, tap the three dots before clicking the Share > Google Plus icon.
- **Step 4:** YouTube will open where you'll tap “Terms and Privacy Policy” to open the Google browser. Here, click Bookmarks and then tap History.
- **Step 5:** The Download History will open with File Manager, where you'll click My Files and then choose SD card.
- **Step 6:** After opening the SD card directory, tap Apex Launcher APK and install Apex Launcher. The menu will automatically transform to the Apex Launcher interface.

- **Step 10:** Go to Device Administrator and enable Android Device Manager.

- **Step 12:** Lastly, restart the locked phone and enjoy the services.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Poco Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Poco, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.
