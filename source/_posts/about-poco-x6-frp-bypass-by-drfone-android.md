This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Poco X6 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Poco X6 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Poco X6 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Poco X6 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Poco X6:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What is Poco X6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco X6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X6 device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Poco X6 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco X6 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X6 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X6 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X6 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco X6 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco X6 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco X6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco X6 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Poco X6 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Poco Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

## Part 1: What is Poco FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn't allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the **Poco FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English **Poco FRP** **code** is \*#813#, and the Chinese code is \*#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.
