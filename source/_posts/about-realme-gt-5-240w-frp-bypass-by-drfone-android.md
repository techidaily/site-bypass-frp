## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Realme GT 5 (240W) FRP

Realme GT 5 (240W) devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Realme GT 5 (240W) device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
