## Part 2: Tecno Spark 10 4G FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Tecno Spark 10 4G Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Tecno Spark 10 4G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Tecno Spark 10 4G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Tecno Spark 10 4G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Tecno Spark 10 4G device.

![add sim to tecno pop 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Tecno Spark 10 4G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
