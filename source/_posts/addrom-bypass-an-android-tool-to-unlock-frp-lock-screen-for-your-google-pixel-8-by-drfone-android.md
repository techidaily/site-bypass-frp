- **Step 2.** Next, you need to run adb.setup.exe and then type Y for installing the drivers for ADB and Fastboot.
- **Step 3.** Again, enter Y for installing the drivers and when done successfully, the command window will close.
- **Step 4.** Next, power on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cable. Here also ensure that USB debugging mode is enabled on your Android device.
- **Step 5.** Next, hold down the Shift key and then right-click at any place blank in the ADB folder, and then choose the Open command window here option.
- **Step 6.** Now to remove the FRP you need to enter the following commands at the command prompt one by one where enter needs to be clicked after every line.

- `_Adb shell am start -n com.google.android.gsf.login/_`
- `_adb shell am start -n com.google.android.gsf.login.LoginActivity_`

## Part 3: Limitations of Using ADB and Fastboot Command Method

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Google Pixel 8 device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
