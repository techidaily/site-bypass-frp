![bypass Honor Magic 5 Lite frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 5 Lite by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 5 Lite device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 5 Lite device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Magic 5 Lite FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 5 Lite device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
