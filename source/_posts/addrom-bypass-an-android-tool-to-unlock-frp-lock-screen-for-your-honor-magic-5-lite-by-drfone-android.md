FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 5 Lite by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 5 Lite device to the user's Google account.
