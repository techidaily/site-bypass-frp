## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Infinix Smart 8 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Infinix Smart 8 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for **Infinix Smart 8 Nord FRP bypass** solutions for seamless device access.

![google frp bypass in oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Infinix Smart 8 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Infinix Smart 8 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### What is Infinix Smart 8 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 device to the user's Google account.

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 8 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 8 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 8 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 8 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 8 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
