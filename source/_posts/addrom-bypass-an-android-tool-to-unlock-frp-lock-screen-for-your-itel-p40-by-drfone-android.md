## Part 1: What’s Itel P40 FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P40 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P40 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P40 device.

The ****Itel P40 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P40 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P40 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P40 device. In essence, the Itel P40 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P40 device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel P40 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Itel P40 FRP Code

To use the Itel P40 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Itel smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Itel customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Itel model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Itel P40 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P40 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Itel P40 FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Itel P40 FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Itel phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Itel P40 FRP:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
