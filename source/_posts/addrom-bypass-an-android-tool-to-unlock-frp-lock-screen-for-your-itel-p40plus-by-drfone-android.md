## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Itel P40+ FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Itel P40+ FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Itel tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Itel smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Itel P40+ FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Itel P40+ FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
