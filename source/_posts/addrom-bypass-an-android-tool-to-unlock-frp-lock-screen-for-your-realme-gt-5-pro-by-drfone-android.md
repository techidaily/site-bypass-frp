![bypass Realme GT 5 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Realme GT 5 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme GT 5 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme GT 5 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme GT 5 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme GT 5 Pro device.

### Purpose of Realme GT 5 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Realme GT 5 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme GT 5 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme GT 5 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme GT 5 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Realme GT 5 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme GT 5 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme GT 5 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

### Steps to remove FRP using Fastboot

- **Step 3.** Next, depending on the system, enter the following command in the CMD window:

- `_Lenovo FRP command_`
- `_fastboot erase config_`
- `_fastboot reboot_`
- `_XIAOMI FRP command_`
- `_fastboot -w_`

- `_DEEP/HTC/Other Brands FRP_`
- `_fastboot erase configfastboot reboot_`

## Part 3: Limitations of Using ADB and Fastboot Command Method

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Realme GT 5 Pro device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
