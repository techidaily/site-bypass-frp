![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Vivo G2 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Vivo G2 device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

## Part 5. FRP Hijacker by Hagard or Wondershare Dr.Fone: Which Is Better?

Now faced with the choice between **FRP Hijacker by Hagard** and Wondershare Dr.Fone, it becomes important to determine which tool aligns best with your specific requirements. Both options promise FRP bypass capabilities, yet they differ in their costs, ease of use, compatibility, and security measures.

Let's delve deeper into each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

|  | **Hijacker by Hagard** | **Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward | Intuitive design with a guided process |
| Security Measures | Using vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to bypass FRP | High encryption and protection measures during the FRP unlocking process |
| Compatibility | Primarily for Samsung devices | Compatible with a wide range of Android and iOS devices. |
| Cost | Generally free | Paid software with a free trial |
| Support and Updates | Limited support; updates may vary | Strong customer support; regular updates |

## Conclusion

**FRP Hijacker by Hagard** presents itself as a targeted solution, particularly effective for Samsung devices. Its simplicity and specialized approach make it an appealing option for users who prioritize ease of use and have Samsung smartphones. However, it's important to note that its effectiveness is confined to Samsung devices, and users should consider this limitation when making a decision.

For those using Android devices other than Samsung or desiring a more versatile solution, Dr.Fone's Screen Unlock tool proves effective and easy to use. Just pick the one that matches your device and preferences for a smooth FRP unlocking experience.
