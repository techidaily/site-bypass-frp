## Part 3. How to Bypass Google Verification on Vivo Without SwiftKey

If the SwiftKey method is not working for removing the FRP lock, another way is to use the APK tools. There are several APK files available to get this task done like FRP Bypass APK, Pangu FRP bypass, and more. Depending on the model of your device, you can choose a free or a premium version as available.

To bypass FRP lock using this method, you would need an APK file, OTG cable, USB stick, and an internet connection that is stable.

Steps **Vivo FRP Bypass Tool** APK

- Step 1. Restart your device and choose Language > English > Next.
- Step 2. Skip the option of Insert SIM card and then connect your Vivo V30 Pro to a stable WiFi network.

- Step 4. Connect the SUB drive to the Vivo V30 Pro device using an OTG cable.

With the above steps, the FRP lock will be bypassed and removed.
