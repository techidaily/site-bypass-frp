## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Vivo X Flip device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Vivo X Flip phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Vivo X Flip FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Vivo X Flip FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Vivo tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Vivo smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Vivo X Flip FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Vivo X Flip FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
