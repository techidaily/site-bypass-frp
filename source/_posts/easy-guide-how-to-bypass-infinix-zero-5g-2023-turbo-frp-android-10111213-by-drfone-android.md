### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device.

After a factory reset, the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Infinix FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Infinix smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Infinix before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. While using your Infinix with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Infinix device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Infinix smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

![add the verification code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** After completing the verification process, you can create a new password for your Google account. Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Infinix smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock.
