## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Nubia FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Nubia frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Nubia Z50S Pro device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Nubia Z50S Pro device.

After a factory reset, the Nubia Z50S Pro device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Nubia Z50S Pro device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Nubia Z50S Pro device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Nubia FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Nubia smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Nubia before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Nubia Z50S Pro device. While using your Nubia with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Nubia Z50S Pro device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Nubia device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Nubia smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

![tap on forgot password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-2.jpg)

- **Step 2:** To verify your identity, utilize the phone number or recovery email associated with your Google account. You will receive a verification code on the phone number or recovery email. Once received, enter the code provided.

![add the verification code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** After completing the verification process, you can create a new password for your Google account. Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Nubia smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.

## Part 2: Definition of Nubia Z50S Pro  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?
