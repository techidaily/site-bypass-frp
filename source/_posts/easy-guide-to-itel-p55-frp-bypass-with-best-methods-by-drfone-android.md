## Part 1: What’s Itel P55 FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P55 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P55 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P55 device.

The ****Itel P55 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P55 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P55 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P55 device. In essence, the Itel P55 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P55 device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel P55 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

At this point, the Itel P55 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P55 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Itel P55 FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Itel smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

Apart from the ****Itel P55 FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Itel phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Itel P55 FRP:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
