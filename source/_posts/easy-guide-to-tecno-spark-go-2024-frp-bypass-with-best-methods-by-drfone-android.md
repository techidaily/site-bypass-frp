It is also included on the Tecno Spark Go (2024) by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark Go (2024) device.

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark Go (2024) FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark Go (2024) device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark Go (2024) device being lost or stolen.
