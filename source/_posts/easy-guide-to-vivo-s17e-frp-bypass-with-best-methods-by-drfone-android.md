Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Vivo S17e device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo S17e device.

The ****Vivo S17e FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo S17e device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo S17e device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo S17e device. In essence, the Vivo S17e FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
