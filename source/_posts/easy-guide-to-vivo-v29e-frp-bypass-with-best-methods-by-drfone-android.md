If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

## Solutions to Bypass Vivo FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Vivo V29e .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Vivo FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Vivo V29e  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.
