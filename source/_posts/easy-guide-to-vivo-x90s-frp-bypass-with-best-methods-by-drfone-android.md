### What is Vivo X90S FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo X90S by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo X90S device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo X90S device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo X90S device.

### Purpose of Vivo X90S FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo X90S FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo X90S device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo X90S device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo X90S device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo X90S FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo X90S device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo X90S after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo X90S device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo X90S FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo X90S is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
