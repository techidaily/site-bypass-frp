Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Vivo FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Vivo .

## Part 1: What is Vivo FRP Bypass Code?

You can enter the **Vivo FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.
