## Part 1: Understanding the Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free.

![bypass Honor Magic5 Ultimate frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic5 Ultimate by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor Magic5 Ultimate FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic5 Ultimate after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Honor Magic5 Ultimate Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Honor Magic5 Ultimate device.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.
