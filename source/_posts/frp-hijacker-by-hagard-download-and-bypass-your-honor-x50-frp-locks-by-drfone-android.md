## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor X50 device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor X50 device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X50 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor X50 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor X50 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor X50 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor X50 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor X50 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor X50 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Honor X50 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Honor X50 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor X50 FRP bypass.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor X50 FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Honor from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.

- **Step 3.** Once your Honor device is successfully connected, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) will automatically detect it.

During the process, it's crucial to keep your device connected to the computer and refrain from disconnecting it until the bypass is complete. After the firmware download is finished, Dr.Fone will initiate the FRP lock bypass process. Once completed, your Honor device will restart, and you'll regain access to it without encountering the FRP lock.
