## Part 1: What’s Realme 11X 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 11X 5G device. In essence, the Realme 11X 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
