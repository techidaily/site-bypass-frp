FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo V30 Lite 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device to the user's Google account.

It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
