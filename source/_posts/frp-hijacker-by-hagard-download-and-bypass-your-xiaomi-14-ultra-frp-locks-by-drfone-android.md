## Part 1: What’s Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP Code and How To Use It

Xiaomi smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

The ****Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. In essence, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, providing additional protection. Each [Xiaomi device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Xiaomi smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP Code

To use the Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Xiaomi smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Xiaomi customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Xiaomi model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Xiaomi smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Xiaomi smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.
