## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
