## Part 2: Definition of Google Pixel 8  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## How to Bypass FRP on Google Pixel 8?

Learning how to **FRP bypass on Google Pixel 8** is vital in many ways. For instance, you might want to hard reset your phone to clear data and remove a bug or virus. Or, you may want to remove every bit of information before gifting or selling the phone. Whichever the case, learning how to bypass FRP on Google Pixel 8 is a cakewalk with this 3-minute read. We'll know how to do that with or without a PC.

## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Google Pixel 8 on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Google Pixel 8 device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Google Pixel 8 devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Google Pixel 8 without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Google Pixel 8, including via YouTube.

Below are the quick steps for Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus:

### Step 1: Dial an emergency number and save it

- 1\. Fire up your locked phone and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.
- 2\. Navigate back to the “Let's go” screen and tap Emergency call. Dial and call 112.
- 3\. Go back to the “Let's go” screen and click Next until you reach the Wi-Fi connection screen. Here, tap Add network and then click the Settings icon on the Samsung keyboard.
- 4\. Click Keyboard layout and feedback > Key-tap feedback. Then, choose Sound and vibration on the Tip section.
- 5\. Next, click Answering and ending calls > Answer automatically. Now enable the toggle before using your two fingers to select “10 seconds” and “Customize.” You'll see a pop-up dialog where you'll click App Info > Call settings > Block numbers.
