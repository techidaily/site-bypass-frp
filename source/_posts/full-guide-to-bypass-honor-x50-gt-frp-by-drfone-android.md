## Part 3. How to Bypass Google Verification on Honor Without SwiftKey

If the SwiftKey method is not working for removing the FRP lock, another way is to use the APK tools. There are several APK files available to get this task done like FRP Bypass APK, Pangu FRP bypass, and more. Depending on the model of your device, you can choose a free or a premium version as available.

To bypass FRP lock using this method, you would need an APK file, OTG cable, USB stick, and an internet connection that is stable.

Steps **Honor FRP Bypass Tool** APK

- Step 1. Restart your device and choose Language > English > Next.
- Step 2. Skip the option of Insert SIM card and then connect your Honor X50 GT to a stable WiFi network.
- Step 3. Transfer the downloaded APK file to the USB drive.
- Step 4. Connect the SUB drive to the Honor X50 GT device using an OTG cable.
- Step 5. Transfer and install the APK file to your Honor device. During the APK installation process, security certification permission needs to be provided.
- Step 6. After the APK installation is done successfully, access to the phone settings will be provided after which you can find the synced Google Account data and delete the same. Alternatively, you can also delete all the settings of the phone.

With the above steps, the FRP lock will be bypassed and removed.

## Part 4. How to Delete a Google Account on Honor after Factory Reset

Removing the FRP lock can put your device at risk if it lands into unauthorized access, but if you find hassle in remembering the Google Account details and doubt you can easily forget it, removing the associated Google account is better as it will also disable the FRP lock.

Also, if you are selling your phone or gifting it to someone, then remove the associated Google Account so that the new owner does not have any issues with the factory reset of the Honor X50 GT device.

**Steps for removing the Google Account from Honor Phone**

- Step 1. On the phone home screen, click on the Settings icon and then look for the Passwords & Accounts option.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
