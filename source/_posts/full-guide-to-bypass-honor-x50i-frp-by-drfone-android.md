That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X50i device.

### Purpose of Honor X50i FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X50i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X50i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X50i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X50i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor X50i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X50i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X50i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X50i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
