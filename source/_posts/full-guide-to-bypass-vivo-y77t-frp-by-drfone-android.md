FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Vivo Y77t device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:
