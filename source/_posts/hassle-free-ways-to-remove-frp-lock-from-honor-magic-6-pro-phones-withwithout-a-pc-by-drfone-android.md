## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Honor ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Honor  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Honor  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

## Part 1: What’s Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Magic 6 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

The ****Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Magic 6 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. In essence, the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP Code

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.
