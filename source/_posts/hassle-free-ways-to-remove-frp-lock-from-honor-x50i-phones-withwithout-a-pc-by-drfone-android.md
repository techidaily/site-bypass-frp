## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Honor X50i Phones with/without a PC

“I just bought a used **Honor** device from the mobile market without checking the already signed in Google account, and I don't even know what Gmail ID is added to this device, so I'm looking for **FRP Honor** bypass tools. Please help.” A user says so on Quora.

In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Honor  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these **FRP bypass Honor** tools.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Honor ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Honor  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Honor  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor X50i device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor X50i device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X50i device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor X50i device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor X50i device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor X50i device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
