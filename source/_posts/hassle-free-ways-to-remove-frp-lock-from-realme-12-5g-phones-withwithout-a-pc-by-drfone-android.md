## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Realme 12 5G Phones with/without a PC

“I just bought a used **Realme** device from the mobile market without checking the already signed in Google account, and I don't even know what Gmail ID is added to this device, so I'm looking for **FRP Realme** bypass tools. Please help.” A user says so on Quora.

In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Realme  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these **FRP bypass Realme** tools.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Realme ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Realme  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Realme  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

## Part 1: What’s Realme 12 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Realme 12 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Realme 12 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Realme 12 5G device.

The ****Realme 12 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 12 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme 12 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 12 5G device. In essence, the Realme 12 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Realme 12 5G device, providing additional protection. Each [Realme device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Realme 12 5G device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Realme smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.
