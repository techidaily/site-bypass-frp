As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Vivo Y100i Power 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
