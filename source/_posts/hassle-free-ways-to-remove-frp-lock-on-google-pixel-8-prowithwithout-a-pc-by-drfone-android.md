## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Google Pixel 8 Pro Phones with/without a PC

“I just bought a used **Google** device from the mobile market without checking the already signed in Google account, and I don't even know what Gmail ID is added to this device, so I'm looking for **FRP Google** bypass tools. Please help.” A user says so on Quora.

In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Google  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these **FRP bypass Google** tools.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Google ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Google  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Google  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Google Pixel 8 Pro device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Google Pixel 8 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Google Pixel 8 Pro Phone?

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:
