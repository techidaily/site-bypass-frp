## Part 1: What’s Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

In essence, the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
