In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Infinix Note 30i FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Note 30i FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Note 30i FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Note 30i FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Note 30i:

![bypass Infinix Note 30i frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Note 30i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Note 30i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Note 30i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Note 30i device.

### Purpose of Infinix Note 30i FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Note 30i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Note 30i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Note 30i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Note 30i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Note 30i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Note 30i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Note 30i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Note 30i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 5. FRP Hijacker by Hagard or Wondershare Dr.Fone: Which Is Better?

Now faced with the choice between **FRP Hijacker by Hagard** and Wondershare Dr.Fone, it becomes important to determine which tool aligns best with your specific requirements. Both options promise FRP bypass capabilities, yet they differ in their costs, ease of use, compatibility, and security measures.

Let's delve deeper into each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

|  | **Hijacker by Hagard** | **Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward | Intuitive design with a guided process |
| Security Measures | Using vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to bypass FRP | High encryption and protection measures during the FRP unlocking process |
| Compatibility | Primarily for Samsung devices | Compatible with a wide range of Android and iOS devices. |
| Cost | Generally free | Paid software with a free trial |
| Support and Updates | Limited support; updates may vary | Strong customer support; regular updates |

## Conclusion

**FRP Hijacker by Hagard** presents itself as a targeted solution, particularly effective for Samsung devices. Its simplicity and specialized approach make it an appealing option for users who prioritize ease of use and have Samsung smartphones. However, it's important to note that its effectiveness is confined to Samsung devices, and users should consider this limitation when making a decision.

For those using Android devices other than Samsung or desiring a more versatile solution, Dr.Fone's Screen Unlock tool proves effective and easy to use. Just pick the one that matches your device and preferences for a smooth FRP unlocking experience.
