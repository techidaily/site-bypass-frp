## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Nubia ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Nubia  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool.

Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Nubia  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

Removing the FRP lock can put your device at risk if it lands into unauthorized access, but if you find hassle in remembering the Google Account details and doubt you can easily forget it, removing the associated Google account is better as it will also disable the FRP lock.

Also, if you are selling your phone or gifting it to someone, then remove the associated Google Account so that the new owner does not have any issues with the factory reset of the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device.

**Steps for removing the Google Account from Nubia Phone**

- Step 1. On the phone home screen, click on the Settings icon and then look for the Passwords & Accounts option.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
