## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Tecno ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Tecno  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Tecno  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

### What is Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark Go (2023) by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Tecno Spark Go (2023) after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Tecno Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Tecno Spark Go (2023) FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
