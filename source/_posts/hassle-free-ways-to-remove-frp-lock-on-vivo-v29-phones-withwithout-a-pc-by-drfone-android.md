So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Vivo FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Vivo phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Vivo Android 11 without PC

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on Vivo V29** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows Vivo users to bypass FRP on any Vivo brand. It's straightforward; this app lets you create another Google Account on your locked Vivo phone without unlocking it. In short, you'll link a new Google Account with a password that you can easily remember.

#### TechnoCare APK Features

- Safe and straightforward Android APK.
- Install custom ROMs on Vivo.
- No registration is required.
- No age restrictions to use.
- User-friendly and quick FRP unlock.

#### Steps to bypass Vivo V29 FRP with TechnoCare APK

- **Step 1:** Start by enabling the Talkback feature on your phone. To do that, tap the Home key three times consecutively on the welcome screen.
- **Step 2:** Now go to the Talkback Menu and then open Talkback Settings. Then, click the Search icon and enter “Getting started with Talkback.”
- **Step 3:** Play the video on the “Getting Started” screen. Then, tap the three dots before clicking the Share > Google Plus icon.
- **Step 4:** YouTube will open where you'll tap “Terms and Privacy Policy” to open the Google browser. Here, click Bookmarks and then tap History.
- **Step 5:** The Download History will open with File Manager, where you'll click My Files and then choose SD card.
- **Step 6:** After opening the SD card directory, tap Apex Launcher APK and install Apex Launcher. The menu will automatically transform to the Apex Launcher interface.
- **Step 7:** Now click Settings and then tap Lock Screen and Security. Then, tap Other Security Settings > Device Administrators. After that, disable the Find My Device option.
- **Step 8:** Navigate back to the Vivo V29 device Settings and choose App. Then, tap the Ellipsis icon and tap “Show system apps.” From the list, choose Google Account Manager and disable it. Do the same with Google Play Services.
- **Step 9:** Open the downloaded TechnoCare FRP APK and install the Technocare app. After installing it, tap Next and then tap Settings > Accounts. Now choose Add account to add another Google Account.
- **Step 10:** Go to Device Administrator and enable Android Device Manager.
- **Step 11:** Navigate back to Settings, click Apps, and enable Google Play Services and Google Account Manager.
- **Step 12:** Lastly, restart the locked phone and enjoy the services.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Vivo Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Vivo, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Vivo

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Vivo Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Vivo and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
