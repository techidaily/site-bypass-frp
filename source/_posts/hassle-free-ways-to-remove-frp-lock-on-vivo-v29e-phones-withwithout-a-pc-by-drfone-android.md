## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Vivo V29e device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Vivo V29e device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

## Part 5: Is Pangu FRP Bypass the Best FRP Removal Tool for You?

**Pangu FRP bypass tool** is free and works on older Android versions. But there are reasons to consider other options. Let's explore them.

Technical Knowledge Required

It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you're not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It's not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn't guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn't work on your device. Choosing other [<u> FRP bypass software</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html) with a higher success rate can save you time.

Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills. If you're comfortable with downloading APK, Pangu can work. But if you prefer ease of use, broader device compatibility, and safety, consider dedicated tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Bypass FRP on Vivo V29e?

Learning how to **FRP bypass on Vivo V29e** is vital in many ways. For instance, you might want to hard reset your phone to clear data and remove a bug or virus. Or, you may want to remove every bit of information before gifting or selling the phone. Whichever the case, learning how to bypass FRP on Vivo V29e is a cakewalk with this 3-minute read. We'll know how to do that with or without a PC.

## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Vivo V29e on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Vivo V29e device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Vivo V29e devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Vivo V29e without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Vivo V29e, including via YouTube.

Below are the quick steps for Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus:

### Step 1: Dial an emergency number and save it

- 1\. Fire up your locked phone and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.
- 2\. Navigate back to the “Let's go” screen and tap Emergency call. Dial and call 112.
- 3\. Go back to the “Let's go” screen and click Next until you reach the Wi-Fi connection screen. Here, tap Add network and then click the Settings icon on the Samsung keyboard.
- 4\. Click Keyboard layout and feedback > Key-tap feedback. Then, choose Sound and vibration on the Tip section.
- 5\. Next, click Answering and ending calls > Answer automatically. Now enable the toggle before using your two fingers to select “10 seconds” and “Customize.” You'll see a pop-up dialog where you'll click App Info > Call settings > Block numbers.
