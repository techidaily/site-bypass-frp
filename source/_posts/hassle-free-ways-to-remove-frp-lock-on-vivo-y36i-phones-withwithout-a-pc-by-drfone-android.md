## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Vivo Y36i device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Vivo Y36i device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

## Part 5: Is Pangu FRP Bypass the Best FRP Removal Tool for You?

**Pangu FRP bypass tool** is free and works on older Android versions. But there are reasons to consider other options. Let's explore them.

Technical Knowledge Required

It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you're not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It's not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn't guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn't work on your device. Choosing other [<u> FRP bypass software</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html) with a higher success rate can save you time.

Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills. If you're comfortable with downloading APK, Pangu can work. But if you prefer ease of use, broader device compatibility, and safety, consider dedicated tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock (Android).
