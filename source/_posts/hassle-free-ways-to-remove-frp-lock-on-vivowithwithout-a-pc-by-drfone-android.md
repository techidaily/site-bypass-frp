## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Vivo ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Vivo  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Vivo  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

### What is Vivo S18e FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo S18e by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo S18e device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo S18e device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo S18e device.

### Purpose of Vivo S18e FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo S18e FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo S18e device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo S18e device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo S18e device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Vivo S18e FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo S18e device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo S18e after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo S18e device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
