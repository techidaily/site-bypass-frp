## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on ZTE Nubia Flip 5G Phones with/without a PC

“I just bought a used **ZTE** device from the mobile market without checking the already signed in Google account, and I don't even know what Gmail ID is added to this device, so I'm looking for **FRP ZTE** bypass tools. Please help.” A user says so on Quora.

In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your ZTE  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these **FRP bypass ZTE** tools.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on ZTE ?

Yes, the Google Lock on ZTE  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your ZTE  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step **ZTE FRP bypass Android 10, 11**, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you'll regain access to your ZTE smartphone even if you've forgotten the associated Google account credentials.

![what is ZTE frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device.

After a factory reset, the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **ZTE FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process.

It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your ZTE before backing up your data.

While using your ZTE with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.
