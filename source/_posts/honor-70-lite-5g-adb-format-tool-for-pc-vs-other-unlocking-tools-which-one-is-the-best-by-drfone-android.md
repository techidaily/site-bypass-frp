- **Step 3.** Once your Honor device is successfully connected, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) will automatically detect it. Follow the on-screen instructions to put your Honor device into specic mode. Once in the correct mode, Dr.Fone will start downloading the necessary firmware to bypass the FRP lock.

During the process, it's crucial to keep your device connected to the computer and refrain from disconnecting it until the bypass is complete. After the firmware download is finished, Dr.Fone will initiate the FRP lock bypass process. Once completed, your Honor device will restart, and you'll regain access to it without encountering the FRP lock.
