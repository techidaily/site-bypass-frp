## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor Play 8T FRP

Honor Play 8T devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Play 8T device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
