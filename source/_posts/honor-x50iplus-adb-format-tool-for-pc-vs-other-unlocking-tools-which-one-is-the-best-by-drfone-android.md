The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor X50i+ device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor X50i+ device.

After a factory reset, the Honor X50i+ device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor X50i+ device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Honor X50i+ device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.
