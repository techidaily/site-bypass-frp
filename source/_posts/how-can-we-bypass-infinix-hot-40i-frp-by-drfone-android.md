### What is Infinix Hot 40i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Hot 40i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Hot 40i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Hot 40i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Hot 40i device.

### Purpose of Infinix Hot 40i FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Hot 40i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Hot 40i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Hot 40i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Hot 40i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Hot 40i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
