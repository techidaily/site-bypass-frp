### 1. Vivo FRP Tool

One of the best tools that you can use to bypass the Factory Reset Protection lock is the Vivo FRP Tool. It is easy to use and doesn't involve too many complicated steps. Plus, it is compatible with most Vivo models, giving you the leverage to access your device without removing or deleting any further data.

#### Step-by-step use

- **Step 1:**The first step is to put your device in fast boot mode. To do so, face down the volume down button for a couple of seconds, automatically initiating the fast boot mode.
- **Step 2:**Now, you have to extract the zip file of the Vivo FRP Tool and then open the tool.

- **Step 3:** It needs to display a comment-like device connected. If you see the comment, click on it as FRP, and the block will get disabled in the fast boot mode.

#### Pros

- Amazing process for the beginners
- Reboot is done in a couple of steps only
- No data will be lost

#### Cons

- You have to put your device in the fast boot mode

#### Limitations

You cannot use this tool until you put the Vivo Y17s device on the fast boot mode.

### 2\. Vivo FRP Eraser

#### Step-by-step use

- **Step 1:** You must download the tool and install Vivo Phone Drivers on your PC.
- **Step 2:** Now, open the app and put the smartphone in Fastboot Mode.

#### Pros

- Easy to use
- Unlocks the Vivo Y17s device within seconds

#### Cons

#### Limitations

### 3\. Vivo FRP & ID Bypass Tool

#### Step-by-step use

- **Step 1:**Open your PC and extract the Vivo FRP and ID lock tool. Now run VivoFRP&IDBypassTool.xe as the admin.
- **Step 2**: Once the program launches, connect your phone to the PC through a USB cable. Then, open the tool.

![bypass frp and id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/bypass-frp-and-id.jpg)

#### Pros

- Does not require any money
- The fastest and most straightforward process of bypassing
- No involvement of Google account or its credentials

#### Cons

- You need to download the file and install it on your PC

#### Limitations

The major limitation of this process is its dependency on a computer or laptop. Next, you won't be able to reboot your device until and unless you connect it to the PC through the USB cable. Some data can get lost due to the automatic reboot system.

**Tips:**

One of the best ways to bypass FRP lock is to disable it beforehand. To do so, go to your settings and click the accounts option. All the accounts like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Google will open up. Click on Google and remove all the saved and active Google accounts. This will automatically disable the FRP lock.
