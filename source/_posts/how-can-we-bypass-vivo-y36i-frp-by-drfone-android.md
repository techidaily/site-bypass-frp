![bypass Vivo Y36i frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo Y36i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y36i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y36i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y36i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y36i device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y36i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y36i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y36i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo Y36i FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo Y36i is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Vivo Y36i FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Vivo Y36i to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Vivo Y36i and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Vivo Y36i to your computer.

### 4\. Ensure a Stable Internet Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is vital for a smooth FRP bypass. Make sure your computer and Vivo Y36i are connected to the internet throughout the process. FRP bypassing will need you to download related files to complete the procedure.
