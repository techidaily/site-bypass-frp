## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Xiaomi FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock.

![what is Xiaomi frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

The FRP lock on your Xiaomi smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password.

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.
