## Part 1: What’s Honor Play 8T FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Play 8T device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Play 8T device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Play 8T device.

The ****Honor Play 8T FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Play 8T device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Play 8T device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Play 8T device. In essence, the Honor Play 8T FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor Play 8T device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor Play 8T device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor Play 8T FRP Code

To use the Honor Play 8T FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Honor smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Honor Play 8T device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor Play 8T device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
