<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Magic 6 Pro device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

![bypass Honor Magic 6 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 6 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic 6 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic 6 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
