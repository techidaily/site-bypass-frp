Infinix smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Infinix Note 30 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Infinix Note 30 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Infinix Note 30 device.

The ****Infinix Note 30 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Infinix Note 30 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Infinix Note 30 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Infinix Note 30 device. In essence, the Infinix Note 30 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30 device, providing additional protection. Each [Infinix device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Infinix Note 30 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Infinix smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.
