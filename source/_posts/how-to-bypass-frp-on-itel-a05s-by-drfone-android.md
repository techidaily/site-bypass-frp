### What is Itel A05s FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel A05s by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel A05s device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel A05s device to the user's Google account.
