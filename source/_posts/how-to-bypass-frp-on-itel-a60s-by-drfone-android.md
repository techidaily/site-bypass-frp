## Part 1: In what cases does the Itel A60s FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Itel A60s FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Itel

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Itel phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Itel A60s FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Itel phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Itel A60s FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Itel from his company no longer works for it
