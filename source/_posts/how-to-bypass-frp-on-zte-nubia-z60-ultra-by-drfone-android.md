## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP

ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
