## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Magic 5 Pro device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Magic 5 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Magic 5 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Honor Magic 5 Pro Phone?

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor Magic 5 Pro device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock.

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Honor uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Honor Magic 5 Pro device would be able to access the Honor Magic 5 Pro device. This aids in preventing the Honor Magic 5 Pro device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Honor Magic 5 Pro devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Honor Magic 5 Pro FRP** challenges with our complete method.

We have included more than two ways to unlock your mobile without any hassle and complication. Just follow this guide, and you will regain access to your device in no time.
