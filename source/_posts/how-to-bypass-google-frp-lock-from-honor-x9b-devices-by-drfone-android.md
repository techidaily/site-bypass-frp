## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Honor X9b Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor X9b smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor X9b device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor X9b device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor X9b phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Honor X9b Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Honor X9b device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Honor X9b Phone

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Honor X9b device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Honor X9b device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor X9b device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock.

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Honor X9b has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor X9b device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor X9b. It is designed to safeguard the Honor X9b device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Honor X9b FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor X9b FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor X9b FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor X9b FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor X9b:

![bypass Honor X9b frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor X9b FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X9b by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X9b device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X9b device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X9b device.

### Purpose of Honor X9b FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X9b FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X9b device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X9b device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X9b device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor X9b FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X9b device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X9b after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X9b device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X9b FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Honor X9b FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor X9b is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Honor X9b FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Honor X9b to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Honor X9b and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Honor X9b to your computer.

## Part 4. Troubleshooting and Tips

Navigating the workings of the **Honor X9b FRP bypass** can be challenging. As with any security feature, FRP is designed to protect your data and device. It makes the bypassing process a delicate task. This part will address common issues faced during FRP bypass attempts.

It will also offer valuable tips to ensure a successful process. Moreover, it will explore alternative methods should the initial approaches prove unsuccessful.

### Common Issues Faced During Bypassing Honor X9b FRP

- **Incorrect Google Account Credentials:** One of the most common issues during FRP bypass is entering incorrect Google account credentials. Double-check the email address and password associated with the Honor X9b device.
- **Unstable Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is crucial during the FRP bypass process. Ensure your device is connected to the internet throughout the procedure and it is not unstable.
- **Outdated Software:** Using outdated or incompatible tools may result in unsuccessful bypass attempts. Always ensure you are using the latest version of the tool or method.
- **Device Compatibility:** Not all bypass methods are universally compatible with all Android devices. Ensure that the method you choose is intended for use with the Honor X9b.

### Tips To Ensure a Successful Bypass Process

1. **Back-Up Data:** Before attempting any bypass method, back up your important data because it will prevent accidental loss during the process.
2. **Verify Official Methods:** Always focus on official methods, such as using Google account credentials. They are better than third-party tools or combination files.
3. **Use Reputable Sources:** If you opt for alternative tools or methods, download them from reputable sources. It will help you avoid malware or security risks.
4. **Read User Reviews:** If using third-party tools, read user reviews and forums. This will help you gauge their effectiveness and safety.
5. **Follow Instructions Carefully:** Whether using official methods or alternative tools, follow instructions diligently to avoid mistakes.

### Alternative Methods or Tools if the Initial Methods Fail

If the initial methods discussed in this article are failed to bypass the Honor X9b FRP, then try these alternate methods to turn off the FRP lock:

#### 1\. Contact the Original Owner for Google Account Credentials

If you have bought the Honor X9b in used condition and it is FRP-locked, try contacting the original owner. They might have the necessary account information to complete the verification process. In case they are able to provide you with Google account credentials, the process to bypass the Honor X9b FRP lock becomes easy and quick.

#### 2\. Contact Honor Customer Services

Have you tried various methods to bypass FRP on your Honor X9b without success? It is the right time to contact professionals. Get in touch with Vivo's official customer services or visit an authorized service center. They have the expertise to handle device-related issues, including FRP lockouts. Explain your situation to the support staff, and they will guide you through the appropriate steps to regain access.
