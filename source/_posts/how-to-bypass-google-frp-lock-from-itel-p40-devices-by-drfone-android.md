## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Itel P40 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Itel P40 smartphones. The facility keeps your device information safe against unauthorized access. However, users often report issues like lockouts not being removed due to several causes. Such scenarios raise the demand for **Itel P40 Nord FRP bypass** solutions for seamless device access.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Itel P40 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Itel P40 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Itel P40 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Itel P40 Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Itel P40 device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Itel P40 Phone

- Switch on the Wi-Fi network of the Itel P40 phone and head to the 'Hello' screen.
- Take the following path:

_**Emergency Call> Emergency Rescue> Add Contact**_

![emergency rescue interface of oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-02.jpg)

- When the permission prompt pops up, click on 'Deny' and tap "Go to Settings".

_**System> Accessibility> Accessibility Menu> Toggle the Button to Turn it On> Allow> Got it**_

- Use an OTG to connect the pen drive to the FRP-locked device.
- Head to the destination folder of the downloaded APK in the "File Manager" application.
- Install the APK in the FRP-locked phone by allowing the app permissions.
- Navigate to 'Settings' and enable the 'Install from Unknown Source' option.

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Itel P40 Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Itel P40 device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Itel P40 device.

![launching the 'settings' application on oneplus phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-05.jpg)

![opening the 'accounts' tab in oneplus phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-06.jpg)

- A list of all the accounts linked to your Itel P40 device will be displayed. Tap on the desired Gmail account to unlink it from your phone.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Itel P40 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Itel P40 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Itel P40 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Itel P40 phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.

## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Itel P40 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

**Pangu FRP bypass tool** is free and works on older Android versions. But there are reasons to consider other options. Let's explore them.

Technical Knowledge Required

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

**Step 5:** Here, you have to follow the on-screen instructions. Find the " **Emergency Call** " button on your Android and click it. Type **#0#** to open a secret menu. Then, click the "**Next** " button on your computer screen.

**Step 6:** You will see a pop-up on your phone's screen to activate USB debugging. After allowing it on your device, click " **Authorized**" on your Dr.Fone screen.

**Step 7:** Dr.Fone will start removing the FRP lock from your Samsung device. Once the process is completed, you will see the interface shown below. You can check your device. If it's successful, you can click "**Done.**" Otherwise, you can try again.

Did you see how easy it is to **bypass the FRP lock** with the help of Dr.Fone? There is no need to manually perform complex steps. Just a few clicks and you are done. However, if you still want to continue with the AddROM Samsung, you must consider some factors.

## Part 6. Factors to Consider Before Using AddROM

Here are some factors that you should consider before using **AddRombypass**:

- Using **AddROM APK** may void your device's warranty. It can impact future support from the manufacturer.
- Bypassing the FRP lock screen with this tool could risk your data and privacy. It can expose your data to vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of legal restrictions surrounding the use of **AddROM**. Make sure it is allowed in your jurisdiction to avoid legal consequences.
- Successfully using AddROM requires technical knowledge. Improper use may lead to device malfunction or data loss.
- Research feedback from other users who have used this tool to bypass FRP locks. It can help you to understand potential risks and benefits.
- Before using **AddROM**, ensure you have backed up important data on your device. It will help you to prevent loss during the unlocking process.

## Conclusion

We all know that FRP locks can be annoying and cause you trouble. But thankfully, there are different ways available to bypass it. We hope you successfully removed the FRP lock and regained access to your Android phone.

Using AddROM FRP bypass is indeed a complex and time-consuming method. Some users couldn't even follow all the steps and left the process in the middle. Whereas, Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is an easy and reliable alternative.

The best thing about this tool is it is not just limited to FRP bypass. There are many other features, such as data recovery, data manager, system cleaner, etc, offered by [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).
