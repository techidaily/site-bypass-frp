## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 90 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 90 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 90 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Honor 90 Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Honor 90 device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Honor 90 Phone

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Honor 90 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 90 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor 90 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor 90 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Honor 90 FRP bypass works?

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements.
