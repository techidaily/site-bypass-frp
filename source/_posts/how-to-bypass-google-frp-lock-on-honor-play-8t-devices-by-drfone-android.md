## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor Play 8T device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor Play 8T device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor Play 8T phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor Play 8T FRP

Honor Play 8T devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Play 8T device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor Play 8T device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass Honor Play 8T FRP With 3 Easy Methods

Bypassing FRP can be a bit tricky, but it's possible to do it if you have the right tools and know-how. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to bypass FRP on your Honor Play 8T device, below are the methods you can use to Honor Play 8T Hot 10 FRP bypass.

### Method #1: Recover the Google Account Of Your Device

Performing a Factory Reset requires restoring a Google account. It is advisable to recover your email ID or password from another device before attempting Honor Play 8T Hot 8 FRP bypass.

You can solve the problem if you have an alternate email address or phone number associated with the account you want to recover. By inserting a verification code, you can easily change the password for your Google account.

After resetting your password, it will take 24 to 72 hours to sync the new password with all devices registered to the account.

Once synced, you can perform a factory data reset by providing an email and a new password. Following this method, you can factory reset your Honor Play 8T Hot S without bypassing FRP.

However, if you provide the wrong password in this process, the time will restart for the next 24-72 hours to sync.

So, be careful when entering your email and password on the Honor Play 8T device.
