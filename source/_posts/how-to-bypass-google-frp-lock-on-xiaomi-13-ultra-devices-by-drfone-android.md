## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Xiaomi 13 Ultra device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi 13 Ultra phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Conclusion

See, you can quickly bypass FRP on Xiaomi 13 Ultra with these methods. But remember that disabling FRP will leave your phone without security protection. Also, bypassing FRP using the YouTube method can be lengthy and complex. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to skip FRP on Android 6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13. Give it a try!
