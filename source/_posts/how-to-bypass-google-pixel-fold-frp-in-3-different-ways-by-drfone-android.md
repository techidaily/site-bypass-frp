## How To Bypass Google Pixel Fold FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Google Pixel Fold FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Google Pixel Fold users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Google Pixel Fold device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Google Pixel Fold smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Google Pixel Fold FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Google Pixel Fold device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Google Pixel Fold device again.
