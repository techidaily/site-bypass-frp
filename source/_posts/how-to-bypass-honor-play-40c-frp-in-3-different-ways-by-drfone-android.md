## How To Bypass Honor Play 40C FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Honor Play 40C users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Honor Play 40C device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Honor Play 40C smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Honor Play 40C FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor Play 40C FRP

Honor Play 40C devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Play 40C device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor Play 40C device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

If the SwiftKey method is not working for removing the FRP lock, another way is to use the APK tools. There are several APK files available to get this task done like FRP Bypass APK, Pangu FRP bypass, and more. Depending on the model of your device, you can choose a free or a premium version as available.

To bypass FRP lock using this method, you would need an APK file, OTG cable, USB stick, and an internet connection that is stable.

Steps **Honor FRP Bypass Tool** APK

- Step 1. Restart your device and choose Language > English > Next.
- Step 2. Skip the option of Insert SIM card and then connect your Honor Play 40C to a stable WiFi network.
- Step 3. Transfer the downloaded APK file to the USB drive.
- Step 4. Connect the SUB drive to the Honor Play 40C device using an OTG cable.
- Step 5. Transfer and install the APK file to your Honor device. During the APK installation process, security certification permission needs to be provided.
- Step 6. After the APK installation is done successfully, access to the phone settings will be provided after which you can find the synced Google Account data and delete the same. Alternatively, you can also delete all the settings of the phone.

## Part 4. How to Delete a Google Account on Honor after Factory Reset

Removing the FRP lock can put your device at risk if it lands into unauthorized access, but if you find hassle in remembering the Google Account details and doubt you can easily forget it, removing the associated Google account is better as it will also disable the FRP lock.

Also, if you are selling your phone or gifting it to someone, then remove the associated Google Account so that the new owner does not have any issues with the factory reset of the Honor Play 40C device.

**Steps for removing the Google Account from Honor Phone**

- Step 1. On the phone home screen, click on the Settings icon and then look for the Passwords & Accounts option.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
