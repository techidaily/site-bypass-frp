## How To Bypass Itel P55T FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Itel P55T FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Itel P55T users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

To unlock the Itel P55T smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Itel P55T FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Itel P55T FRP

Itel P55T devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel P55T device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Itel P55T device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Itel smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
