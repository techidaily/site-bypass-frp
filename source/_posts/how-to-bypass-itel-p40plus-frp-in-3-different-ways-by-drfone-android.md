Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Itel P40+ FRP

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel P40+ device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Itel P40+ device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

### What is Itel P40+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P40+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P40+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P40+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P40+ device.

### Purpose of Itel P40+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P40+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P40+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P40+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P40+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P40+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P40+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P40+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P40+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
