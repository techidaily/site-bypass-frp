## How To Bypass Itel P40+ FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Itel P40+ FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Itel P40+ users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Itel P40+ device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Itel P40+ smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Itel P40+ FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Itel P40+ devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel P40+ device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Itel P40+ device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel P40+ FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel P40+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel P40+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel P40+:

![bypass Itel P40+ frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Itel P40+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P40+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P40+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P40+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P40+ device.

### Purpose of Itel P40+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P40+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P40+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P40+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P40+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P40+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P40+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P40+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P40+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 4. Troubleshooting and Tips

Navigating the workings of the **Itel P40+ FRP bypass** can be challenging. As with any security feature, FRP is designed to protect your data and device. It makes the bypassing process a delicate task. This part will address common issues faced during FRP bypass attempts.

It will also offer valuable tips to ensure a successful process. Moreover, it will explore alternative methods should the initial approaches prove unsuccessful.

### Common Issues Faced During Bypassing Itel P40+ FRP

- **Incorrect Google Account Credentials:** One of the most common issues during FRP bypass is entering incorrect Google account credentials. Double-check the email address and password associated with the Itel P40+ device.
- **Unstable Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is crucial during the FRP bypass process. Ensure your device is connected to the internet throughout the procedure and it is not unstable.
- **Outdated Software:** Using outdated or incompatible tools may result in unsuccessful bypass attempts. Always ensure you are using the latest version of the tool or method.
- **Device Compatibility:** Not all bypass methods are universally compatible with all Android devices. Ensure that the method you choose is intended for use with the Itel P40+.

### Tips To Ensure a Successful Bypass Process

1. **Back-Up Data:** Before attempting any bypass method, back up your important data because it will prevent accidental loss during the process.
2. **Verify Official Methods:** Always focus on official methods, such as using Google account credentials. They are better than third-party tools or combination files.
3. **Use Reputable Sources:** If you opt for alternative tools or methods, download them from reputable sources. It will help you avoid malware or security risks.
4. **Read User Reviews:** If using third-party tools, read user reviews and forums. This will help you gauge their effectiveness and safety.
5. **Follow Instructions Carefully:** Whether using official methods or alternative tools, follow instructions diligently to avoid mistakes.

### Alternative Methods or Tools if the Initial Methods Fail

If the initial methods discussed in this article are failed to bypass the Itel P40+ FRP, then try these alternate methods to turn off the FRP lock:

#### 1\. Contact the Original Owner for Google Account Credentials

If you have bought the Itel P40+ in used condition and it is FRP-locked, try contacting the original owner. They might have the necessary account information to complete the verification process. In case they are able to provide you with Google account credentials, the process to bypass the Itel P40+ FRP lock becomes easy and quick.

#### 2\. Contact Itel Customer Services
