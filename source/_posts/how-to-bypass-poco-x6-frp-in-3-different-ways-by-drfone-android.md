## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Poco X6 FRP

Poco X6 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Poco X6 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Poco X6 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

The Poco Emergency FRP Code is an alternative method to bypass FRP, relying on a unique code provided by the Poco X6 device manufacturer. After you do a factory reset on your Poco smartphone, don't rush to set it up. If you set up your device, the FRP lock will appear on the screen. When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That's where you will be entering the **Poco FRP bypass code**. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.
