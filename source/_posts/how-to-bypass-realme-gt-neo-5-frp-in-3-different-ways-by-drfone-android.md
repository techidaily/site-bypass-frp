## How To Bypass Realme GT Neo 5 FRP In 3 Different Ways

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme GT Neo 5 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme GT Neo 5 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
