## How To Bypass Tecno Spark 20C FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Tecno Spark 20C FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Tecno Spark 20C users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Tecno Spark 20C device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Tecno Spark 20C smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Tecno Spark 20C FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Tecno Spark 20C device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Tecno Spark 20C device again.
