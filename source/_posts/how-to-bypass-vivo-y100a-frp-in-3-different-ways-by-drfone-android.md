### What is Vivo Y100A FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y100A by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100A device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y100A device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y100A device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y100A FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y100A FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y100A device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y100A device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y100A device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
