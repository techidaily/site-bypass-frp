Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials.

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
