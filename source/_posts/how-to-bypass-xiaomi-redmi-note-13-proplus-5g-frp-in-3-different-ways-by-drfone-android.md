### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Xiaomi FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Xiaomi FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G  with your PC by using a USB cable.

**Step 2:**

A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.
