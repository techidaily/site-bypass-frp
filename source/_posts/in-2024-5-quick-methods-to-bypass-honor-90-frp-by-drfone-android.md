## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 90 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor 90 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor 90 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Honor 90 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Honor 90 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor 90 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor 90 FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Honor from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.

## Part 1: What’s Honor 90 FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 90 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 90 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 90 device.

The ****Honor 90 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 90 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 90 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 90 device. In essence, the Honor 90 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor 90 device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor 90 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor 90 FRP Code

To use the Honor 90 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code
