- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Honor 90 Pro device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.

## Part 4: The Best ADB Alternative to Bypass FRP Lock on Android Phones

Considering the several limitations of the ADB and Fastboot command method, the need for a simple, user-friendly, and workable solution for removing FRP lock on Android devices arises. One of the best software here that we recommend is [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) which helps in removing and bypassing many Android phone screen locks including the one appearing due to FRP lock.
