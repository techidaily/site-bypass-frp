## The Updated Method to Bypass Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Infinix uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device would be able to access the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. This aids in preventing the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device.
