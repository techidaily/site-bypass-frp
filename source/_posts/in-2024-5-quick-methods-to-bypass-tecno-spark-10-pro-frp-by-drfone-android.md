## Part 1: In what cases does the Tecno Spark 10 Pro FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Tecno Spark 10 Pro FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Tecno

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Tecno phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Tecno Spark 10 Pro FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Tecno phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Tecno Spark 10 Pro FRP bypass.

### 3\. The person with a Tecno from his company no longer works for it

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.
