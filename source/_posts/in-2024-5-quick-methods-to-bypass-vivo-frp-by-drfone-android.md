Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Vivo S18e device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Vivo smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Vivo S18e device and the system.

It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Vivo S18e device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.
