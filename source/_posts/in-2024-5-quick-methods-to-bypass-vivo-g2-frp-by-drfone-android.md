## Part 2: Definition of Vivo G2  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

But before starting, let’s learn about **AddROM**!

## Part 1. What is AddROM?

But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device.
