### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Vivo V27 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Vivo V27 device.

After a factory reset, the Vivo V27 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Vivo V27 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Vivo V27 device.

First, verify that your Vivo smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions.

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.
