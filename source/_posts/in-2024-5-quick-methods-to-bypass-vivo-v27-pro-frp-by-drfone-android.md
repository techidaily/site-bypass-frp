#### Pros

- Does not require any money
- The fastest and most straightforward process of bypassing
- No involvement of Google account or its credentials

#### Cons

- You need to download the file and install it on your PC

#### Limitations

The major limitation of this process is its dependency on a computer or laptop. Next, you won't be able to reboot your device until and unless you connect it to the PC through the USB cable. Some data can get lost due to the automatic reboot system.

**Tips:**

One of the best ways to bypass FRP lock is to disable it beforehand. To do so, go to your settings and click the accounts option. All the accounts like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Google will open up. Click on Google and remove all the saved and active Google accounts. This will automatically disable the FRP lock.
