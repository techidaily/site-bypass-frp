## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y77t FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y77t device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo Y77t device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y77t device.

The ****Vivo Y77t FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y77t device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y77t device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y77t device. In essence, the Vivo Y77t FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo Y77t device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html)possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo Y77t device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Vivo Y77t FRP Code

At this point, the Vivo Y77t device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo Y77t device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
