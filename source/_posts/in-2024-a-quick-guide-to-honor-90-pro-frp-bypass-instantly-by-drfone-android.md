Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Honor 90 Pro has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor 90 Pro device's impressive features and affordability.

It is designed to safeguard the Honor 90 Pro device from unauthorized access.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Honor 90 Pro FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor 90 Pro FRP

![bypass Honor 90 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor 90 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 90 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 90 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 90 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 90 Pro device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Purpose of Honor 90 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 90 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 90 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 90 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 90 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor 90 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 90 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 90 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 90 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials.

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor 90 Pro device again.
