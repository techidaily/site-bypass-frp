## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Itel ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Itel  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool.

Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Itel  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
