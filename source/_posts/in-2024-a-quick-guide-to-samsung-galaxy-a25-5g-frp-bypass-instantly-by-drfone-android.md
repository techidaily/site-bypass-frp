### What is Samsung Galaxy A25 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G device to the user's Google account.
