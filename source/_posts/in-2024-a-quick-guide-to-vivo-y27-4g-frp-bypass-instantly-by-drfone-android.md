It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

### What is Vivo Y27 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y27 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y27 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y27 4G device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Vivo Y27 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y27 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y27 4G device.
