### What is Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro FRP
