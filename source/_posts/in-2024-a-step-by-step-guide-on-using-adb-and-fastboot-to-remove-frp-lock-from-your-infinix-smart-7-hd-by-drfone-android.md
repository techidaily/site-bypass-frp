FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 7 HD by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 7 HD device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device being lost or stolen.
