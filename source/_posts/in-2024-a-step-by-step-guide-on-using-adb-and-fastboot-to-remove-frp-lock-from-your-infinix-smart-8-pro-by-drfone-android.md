This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Smart 8 Pro:

![bypass Infinix Smart 8 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Smart 8 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 8 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

Both options promise FRP bypass capabilities, yet they differ in their costs, ease of use, compatibility, and security measures.

Let's delve deeper into each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

|  | **Hijacker by Hagard** | **Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward | Intuitive design with a guided process |
| Security Measures | Using vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to bypass FRP | High encryption and protection measures during the FRP unlocking process |
| Compatibility | Primarily for Samsung devices | Compatible with a wide range of Android and iOS devices. |
| Cost | Generally free | Paid software with a free trial |
