## Part 2: Definition of Vivo X Flip  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
