It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
