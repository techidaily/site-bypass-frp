### What is Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device to the user's Google account.
