### What is ZTE Axon 40 Lite FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the ZTE Axon 40 Lite by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of ZTE Axon 40 Lite FRP

The primary purpose of ZTE Axon 40 Lite FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
