FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

The primary purpose of ZTE Axon 40 Lite FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device being lost or stolen.
