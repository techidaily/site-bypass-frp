## Part 1: Quick Overview of ADB and Fastboot Commands

### 1\. What are ADB and Fastboot?

Standing for Android Debug Bridge, ADB and Fastboots are the methods through which communication with an Android device can be done through a computer. Under this method, the commands and the actions that are sent from the system are performed on your Android device.

Several issues can be resolved, and multiple functions can be performed using the **ADB format tool** and Fastboots, and this also includes removing the FRP lock on your Android device. To use this method, USB debugging should be enabled on the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device.

For specific brands of Android phones, specific utility tools are available like the **Vivo ADB format tool** and the **Samsung ADB format tool**, which are used explicitly for Vivo and Samsung phones, respectively.

### 2\. How Do ADB and Fastboot Bypass FRP?

Using the versatile ADB command-line tool and Fastboots, the Google FRP lock can be removed using several commands depending on the OS version. This is a client-server program that includes a client who sends the commands, a daemon used to run the commands on the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device, and a server that facilitates communication between the client and the daemon.

ADB comes included in the Android SDK Platform-Tools package, and this can be downloaded using the SDK manager.

### 3\. What Are the Android Versions that ADB and Fastboot Command Support?

The Android versions on which ADB and Fastboot commands can be used are as follows:

- `_Android 5 – Lollipop_`
- `_Android 6- Marshmellow_`
- `_Android 7 – Nougat_`
- `_Android 8- Oreo_`
- `_Android 9- Pie_`

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.

## Part 4: The Best ADB Alternative to Bypass FRP Lock on Android Phones
