Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 100 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 100 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 100 Pro device.

The ****Honor 100 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 100 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 100 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 100 Pro device. In essence, the Honor 100 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
