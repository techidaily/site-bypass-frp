Standing for Android Debug Bridge, ADB and Fastboots are the methods through which communication with an Android device can be done through a computer. Under this method, the commands and the actions that are sent from the system are performed on your Android device.

Several issues can be resolved, and multiple functions can be performed using the **ADB format tool** and Fastboots, and this also includes removing the FRP lock on your Android device. To use this method, USB debugging should be enabled on the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

For specific brands of Android phones, specific utility tools are available like the **Vivo ADB format tool** and the **Samsung ADB format tool**, which are used explicitly for Vivo and Samsung phones, respectively.

### What is Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 70 Lite 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

### Purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 70 Lite 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 70 Lite 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 70 Lite 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 70 Lite 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
