FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Play 40C by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Play 40C device.

### Purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Play 40C FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Play 40C device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Play 40C device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Play 40C device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
