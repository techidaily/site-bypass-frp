## Part 1: What’s Realme 11X 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Realme 11X 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 11X 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme 11X 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 11X 5G device. In essence, the Realme 11X 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
