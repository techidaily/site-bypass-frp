### What is Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices.

### Purpose of Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition device.
