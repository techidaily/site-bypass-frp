![bypass Google Pixel 8 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Google Pixel 8 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Google Pixel 8 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Google Pixel 8 Pro device.

The primary purpose of Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Google Pixel 8 Pro device being lost or stolen.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP

Google Pixel 8 Pro devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Google Pixel 8 Pro device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
