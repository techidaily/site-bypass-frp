## Part 1: What’s Infinix Note 30 FRP Code and How To Use It

Infinix smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Infinix Note 30 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Infinix Note 30 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Infinix Note 30 device.

The ****Infinix Note 30 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Infinix Note 30 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Infinix Note 30 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Infinix Note 30 device. In essence, the Infinix Note 30 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30 device, providing additional protection. Each [Infinix device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Infinix Note 30 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Infinix smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Infinix Note 30 FRP Code

To use the Infinix Note 30 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Infinix smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Infinix customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Infinix model.

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Infinix smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Infinix Note 30 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Infinix Note 30 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
