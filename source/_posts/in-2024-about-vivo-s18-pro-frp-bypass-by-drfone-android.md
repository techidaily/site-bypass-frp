## Part 1: What’s Vivo S18 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.
