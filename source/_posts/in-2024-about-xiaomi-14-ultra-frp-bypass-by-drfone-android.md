It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Xiaomi. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
