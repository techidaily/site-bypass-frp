## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor 90 FRP

Honor 90 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor 90 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

## Part 1: What’s Honor 90 FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 90 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 90 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 90 device.

The ****Honor 90 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 90 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 90 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 90 device. In essence, the Honor 90 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor 90 device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor 90 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor 90 FRP Code

To use the Honor 90 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Honor customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Honor model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Honor smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Honor 90 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor 90 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Honor 90 FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Honor smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Honor 90 FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Honor 90 FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Honor phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Honor 90 FRP:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
