### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Itel P55T .

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Itel P55T  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Itel P55T . To proceed, click "Remove account."

### What is Itel P55T FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P55T by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55T device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P55T device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P55T device.

### Purpose of Itel P55T FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P55T FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P55T device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P55T device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P55T device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P55T FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P55T device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P55T after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P55T device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

Before proceeding with the Itel P55T FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel P55T is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
