## Part 1: What is Itel FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn't allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the **Itel FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English **Itel FRP** **code** is \*#813#, and the Chinese code is \*#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.
