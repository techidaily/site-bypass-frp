## Part 1: What’s Tecno Spark 20 FRP Code and How To Use It

Tecno smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Tecno Spark 20 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Tecno Spark 20 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Tecno Spark 20 device.

The ****Tecno Spark 20 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Tecno Spark 20 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Tecno Spark 20 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Tecno Spark 20 device. In essence, the Tecno Spark 20 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 device, providing additional protection. Each [Tecno device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Tecno Spark 20 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Tecno smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.
