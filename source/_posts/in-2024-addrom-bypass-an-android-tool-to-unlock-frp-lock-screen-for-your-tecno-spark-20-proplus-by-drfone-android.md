## Part 2: Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Tecno Spark 20 Pro+:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device.
