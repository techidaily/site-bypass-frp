## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Vivo Y200 FRP

Vivo Y200 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y200 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Vivo Y200 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Vivo FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Vivo phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Vivo

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Vivo Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Vivo and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
