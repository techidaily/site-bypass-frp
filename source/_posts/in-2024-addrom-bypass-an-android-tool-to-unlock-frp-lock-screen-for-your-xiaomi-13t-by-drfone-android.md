Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

## Easy Guide How To Bypass Xiaomi 13T FRP Android 10/11/12/13

At times it can pose a challenge for users who find themselves locked out of their own devices.

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step **Xiaomi FRP bypass Android 10, 11**, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you'll regain access to your Xiaomi smartphone even if you've forgotten the associated Google account credentials.

## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Xiaomi FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock.

It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Xiaomi frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi 13T device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi 13T device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi 13T device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi 13T device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi 13T device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Xiaomi 13T device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Xiaomi FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Xiaomi smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Xiaomi before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Xiaomi 13T device. While using your Xiaomi with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Xiaomi 13T device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Xiaomi device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Xiaomi smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

**Solution:** Attempt the process again by following the instructions meticulously. Double-check that you have entered the correct information and followed each step accurately.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass. If not, try switching to a different network, such as taking a mobile hotspot from your family member or friend. You can also reset your network settings if connectivity issues persist.

### General Tips for a Successful FRP Bypass Process

To increase the likelihood of a successful FRP bypass on your Xiaomi device, consider the following general tips:

#### 1\. Research and Understand the Method

Familiarize yourself with the Viva Y20 FRP bypass Android 12 method you intend to use. Read tutorials, watch videos, and gather information. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the instructions involved for your selected methods to perform successfully.

#### 2\. Ensure Device Compatibility

Verify that the FRP bypass method or tool you plan to use is compatible with your specific Xiaomi device. It should be compatible with the model and the Android version it is running. Using incompatible methods can lead to errors and unsuccessful bypass attempts.

Pay close attention to each step of the **Xiaomi FRP bypass Android 13** process. Follow the instructions precisely. At times even a minor mistake can hinder the success of the bypass.
