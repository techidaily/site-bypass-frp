### What is Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi 13T Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 13T Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi 13T Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi 13T Pro device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi 13T Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi 13T Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi 13T Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi 13T Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi 13T Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi 13T Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
