### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Google Pixel Fold device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Google Pixel Fold device.

After a factory reset, the Google Pixel Fold device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Google Pixel Fold device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Google Pixel Fold device.

It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Google smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Google before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Google Pixel Fold device. While using your Google with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

![bypass Google Pixel Fold frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Google Pixel Fold FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Google Pixel Fold by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Google Pixel Fold device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Google Pixel Fold device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Google Pixel Fold device.

### Purpose of Google Pixel Fold FRP

The primary purpose of Google Pixel Fold FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Google Pixel Fold device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Google Pixel Fold device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Google Pixel Fold device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Google Pixel Fold FRP

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Google Pixel Fold device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
