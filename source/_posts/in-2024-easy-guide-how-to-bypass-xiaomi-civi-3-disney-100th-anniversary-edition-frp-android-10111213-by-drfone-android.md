### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

First, verify that your Xiaomi smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Xiaomi before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. While using your Xiaomi with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Xiaomi device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.
