The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device data and applications.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device.

This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.
