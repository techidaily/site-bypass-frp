### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Xiaomi before backing up your data.

While using your Xiaomi with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

### Charging the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Xiaomi device to at least 50%.

A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Xiaomi Redmi K70 FRP

Xiaomi Redmi K70 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
