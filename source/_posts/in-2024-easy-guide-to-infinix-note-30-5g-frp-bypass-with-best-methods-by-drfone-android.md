#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Infinix smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Infinix Note 30 5G device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Infinix Note 30 5G device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Infinix Note 30 5G FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Infinix smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.
