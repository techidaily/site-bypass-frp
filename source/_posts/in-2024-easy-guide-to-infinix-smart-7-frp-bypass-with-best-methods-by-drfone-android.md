![bypass Infinix Smart 7 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Smart 7 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 7 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 7 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 7 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 7 device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Infinix Smart 7 FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 7 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 7 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 7 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 7 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Smart 7 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Smart 7 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 7 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 7 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Infinix Smart 7 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Infinix Smart 7 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Smart 7 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Infinix Smart 7 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Infinix Smart 7 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.
