### What is Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP
