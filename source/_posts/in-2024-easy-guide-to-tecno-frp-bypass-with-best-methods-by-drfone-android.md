## Part 2: Definition of Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions.

It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
