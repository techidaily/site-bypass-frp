Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it.

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Tecno Pova 5 Pro FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Tecno Pova 5 Pro FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Tecno Pova 5 Pro FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Tecno phone to remove all locks and password requirements.

### 3\. The person with a Tecno from his company no longer works for it
