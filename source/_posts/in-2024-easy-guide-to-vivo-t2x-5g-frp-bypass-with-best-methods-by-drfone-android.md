## Part 2: How To Bypass Vivo T2x 5G FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Vivo T2x 5G FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Vivo phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Vivo T2x 5G FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
