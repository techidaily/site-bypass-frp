### What is Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi 13T Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 13T Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi 13T Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi 13T Pro device.

The primary purpose of Xiaomi 13T Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi 13T Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi 13T Pro device being lost or stolen.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi 13T Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
