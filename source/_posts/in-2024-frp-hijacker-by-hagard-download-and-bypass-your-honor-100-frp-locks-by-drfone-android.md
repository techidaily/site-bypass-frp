## Part 2: Honor 100 FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Honor 100 Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Honor 100 and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Honor 100 device.
