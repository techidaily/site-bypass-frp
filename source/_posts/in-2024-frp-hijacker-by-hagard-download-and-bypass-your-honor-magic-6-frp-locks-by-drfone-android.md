![bypass Honor Magic 6 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic 6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic 6 FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Magic 6 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 6 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 6 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 6 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor Magic 6 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic 6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
