## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Honor FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies.

![what is Honor frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor Magic Vs 2 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device.

After a factory reset, the Honor Magic Vs 2 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor Magic Vs 2 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Honor Magic Vs 2 device.

It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.
