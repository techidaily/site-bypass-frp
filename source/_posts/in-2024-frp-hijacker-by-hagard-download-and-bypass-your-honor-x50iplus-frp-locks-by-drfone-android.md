Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don't know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.

However, in most cases, users don't remember their Google ID and password. This is where ****AddROM** Bypass** steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.

But before starting, let’s learn about **AddROM**!

### What is Honor X50i+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X50i+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X50i+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X50i+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X50i+ device.

### Purpose of Honor X50i+ FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X50i+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X50i+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X50i+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X50i+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Honor X50i+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X50i+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X50i+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X50i+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.
