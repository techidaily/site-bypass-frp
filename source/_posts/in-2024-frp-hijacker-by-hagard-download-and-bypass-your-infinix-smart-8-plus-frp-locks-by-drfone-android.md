## Part 1. What is AddROM?

**AddROM** is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.

But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

![Download and install the HushSMS.apk file.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png)

**Step 3:** After the app is installed, open it and click "**WAP PUSH SL.**" Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type "www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" and click the "**SEND WAP PUSH SL** " button.

![Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png)

**Step 4:** Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner and select "Terms & Privacy Policies."

**Step 5:** After clicking Terms & Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type "**addrom.com/bypass,**" scroll down, and then download the relevant "**Google Account Manager** " (GAM) APK.
