### What is Itel P40+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P40+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P40+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P40+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P40+ device.

### Purpose of Itel P40+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P40+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P40+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P40+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P40+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Itel P40+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P40+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P40+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P40+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel P40+ FRP
