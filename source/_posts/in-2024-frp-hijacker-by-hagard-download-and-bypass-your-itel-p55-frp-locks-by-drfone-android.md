## Part 3: Itel P55 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Itel P55 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Itel P55 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Itel Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

- **Step 3.** Choose “Permissions” and tap the “Search” icon at the top-right corner of the follow-up screen. Search for “Settings” and pick the respective app from the results list. Tap "Open" to access the Settings application. This action will direct you to the “Settings” interface.

- **Step 4.** Navigate to "App management" and select "App settings." Access the XShare APK, launch it, and ensure you have a secondary Android device available. Open the Play Store on the second device, and download and install the XShare App for further processing.

[<u>https://tiny</u>](https://tiny/).cc/frptools or [<u>https://bit</u>](https://bit/).ly/2NkxXYs

![download xshare app on new device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-17.jpg)

- **Step 6.** Open the XShare APK on your second Android device. Navigate to the downloaded apps and tap “Send.” Return to the FRP phone and select “Receive” on it. Scan the QR code to establish a connection between the Itel P55 devices. Verify on your FRP phone that both FRP APK files have been received and proceed with the installation.
