## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Itel P55 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Itel P55 FRP bypass works?

How and why should I bypass Itel P55 FRP? Let us look at the valid reasons.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Itel

Some employees also receive official phones from their company which they have to return when they leave the company. Now, it becomes a horror story for the new employee if he gets the same phone locked with the previous user's ID.
