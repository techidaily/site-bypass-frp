## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Realme Narzo 60 5G FRP

Realme Narzo 60 5G devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Realme Narzo 60 5G device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment
