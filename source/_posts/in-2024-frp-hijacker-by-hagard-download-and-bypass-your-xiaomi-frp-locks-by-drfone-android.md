Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device's security measures.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Xiaomi before backing up your data.

## Part 2: Definition of Xiaomi 14 Ultra  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
