## Part 1: Understanding the Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C:

![bypass Xiaomi Redmi 13C frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Redmi 13C FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Redmi 13C after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
