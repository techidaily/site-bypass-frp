## Ultimate Guide on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Xiaomi phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Xiaomi FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Xiaomi phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Xiaomi FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Xiaomi phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Xiaomi phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Xiaomi FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Xiaomi phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

![what is Xiaomi frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device.

After a factory reset, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device.

While using your Xiaomi with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G device Adequately

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

### Common Issues and Their Solutions

Before we lead into an assessment of the tips that one can follow to avoid issues with their Xiaomi FRP bypass process, it is necessary to guide users with the problems involving the process. However, along with the issues, all the required solutions are associated with them.

#### 1\. Faulty USB Connection

 During the bypass process, your computer may fail to detect your Xiaomi device when connected via USB.

**Solution:** Ensure your Xiaomi device is properly connected to your computer via a USB cable. Moreover, try using a different laptop port or USB cable but confirm it is original to fix any connection-related issues.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Xiaomi device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Xiaomi device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.

#### 3\. Retry Bypass Methods

The bypass method you have chosen may not be successful in bypassing FRP on your device.

**Solution:** Attempt the process again by following the instructions meticulously. Double-check that you have entered the correct information and followed each step accurately.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass. If not, try switching to a different network, such as taking a mobile hotspot from your family member or friend. You can also reset your network settings if connectivity issues persist.

### General Tips for a Successful FRP Bypass Process

#### 1\. Research and Understand the Method

Familiarize yourself with the Viva Y20 FRP bypass Android 12 method you intend to use. Read tutorials, watch videos, and gather information. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the instructions involved for your selected methods to perform successfully.

#### 2\. Ensure Device Compatibility

Verify that the FRP bypass method or tool you plan to use is compatible with your specific Xiaomi device. It should be compatible with the model and the Android version it is running. Using incompatible methods can lead to errors and unsuccessful bypass attempts.

#### 3\. Follow the Instructions Carefully

Pay close attention to each step of the **Xiaomi FRP bypass Android 13** process. Follow the instructions precisely. At times even a minor mistake can hinder the success of the bypass.
