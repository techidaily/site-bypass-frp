## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R, including via YouTube.
