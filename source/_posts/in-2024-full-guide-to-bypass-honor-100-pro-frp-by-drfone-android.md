## Part 1: Understanding the Honor 100 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor 100 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor 100 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor 100 Pro:

![bypass Honor 100 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor 100 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 100 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 100 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 100 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 100 Pro device.

### Purpose of Honor 100 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 100 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 100 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 100 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 100 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor 100 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 100 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 100 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 100 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
