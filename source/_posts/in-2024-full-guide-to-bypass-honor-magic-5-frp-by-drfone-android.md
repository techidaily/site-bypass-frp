- **Unstable Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is crucial during the FRP bypass process. Ensure your device is connected to the internet throughout the procedure and it is not unstable.
- **Outdated Software:** Using outdated or incompatible tools may result in unsuccessful bypass attempts. Always ensure you are using the latest version of the tool or method.
- **Device Compatibility:** Not all bypass methods are universally compatible with all Android devices. Ensure that the method you choose is intended for use with the Honor Magic 5.

### Tips To Ensure a Successful Bypass Process

1. **Back-Up Data:** Before attempting any bypass method, back up your important data because it will prevent accidental loss during the process.
2. **Verify Official Methods:** Always focus on official methods, such as using Google account credentials. They are better than third-party tools or combination files.
3. **Use Reputable Sources:** If you opt for alternative tools or methods, download them from reputable sources. It will help you avoid malware or security risks.
4. **Read User Reviews:** If using third-party tools, read user reviews and forums. This will help you gauge their effectiveness and safety.
5. **Follow Instructions Carefully:** Whether using official methods or alternative tools, follow instructions diligently to avoid mistakes.
