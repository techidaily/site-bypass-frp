## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

The feature also protects the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
