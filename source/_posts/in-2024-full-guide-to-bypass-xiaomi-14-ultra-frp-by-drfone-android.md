Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Xiaomi uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device would be able to access the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. This aids in preventing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Xiaomi 14 Ultra devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.
