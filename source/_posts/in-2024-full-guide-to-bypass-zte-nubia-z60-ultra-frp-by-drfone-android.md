## Part 2: Definition of ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **ZTE FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your ZTE phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their ZTE phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass ZTE FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old ZTE phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on ZTE Android 11 without PC

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows ZTE users to bypass FRP on any ZTE brand. It's straightforward; this app lets you create another Google Account on your locked ZTE phone without unlocking it. In short, you'll link a new Google Account with a password that you can easily remember.

#### TechnoCare APK Features

- Safe and straightforward Android APK.
- Install custom ROMs on ZTE.
- No registration is required.
- No age restrictions to use.
- User-friendly and quick FRP unlock.

#### Steps to bypass ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP with TechnoCare APK

- **Step 1:** Start by enabling the Talkback feature on your phone. To do that, tap the Home key three times consecutively on the welcome screen.
- **Step 2:** Now go to the Talkback Menu and then open Talkback Settings. Then, click the Search icon and enter “Getting started with Talkback.”
- **Step 3:** Play the video on the “Getting Started” screen. Then, tap the three dots before clicking the Share > Google Plus icon.
- **Step 4:** YouTube will open where you'll tap “Terms and Privacy Policy” to open the Google browser. Here, click Bookmarks and then tap History.
- **Step 5:** The Download History will open with File Manager, where you'll click My Files and then choose SD card.
- **Step 6:** After opening the SD card directory, tap Apex Launcher APK and install Apex Launcher. The menu will automatically transform to the Apex Launcher interface.

- **Step 12:** Lastly, restart the locked phone and enjoy the services.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All ZTE Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on ZTE, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on ZTE

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **ZTE Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on ZTE and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
