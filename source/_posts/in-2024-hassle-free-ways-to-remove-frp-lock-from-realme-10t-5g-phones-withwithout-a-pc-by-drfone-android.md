Are you having trouble bypassing Realme 10T 5G FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Realme 10T 5G users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Realme 10T 5G device and use the same Gmail account.
