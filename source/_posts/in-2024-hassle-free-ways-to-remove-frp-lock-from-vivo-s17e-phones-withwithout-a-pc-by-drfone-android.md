Below you'll find answers to some of the most common questions regarding bypassing Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on Vivo devices.

### 1\. What is the FRP skip code for Vivo ?

Currently, there is no universally applicable "FRP skip code" for Vivo devices. FRP is a security feature, designed to prevent unauthorized access to your device after a factory reset. If you are the legitimate owner and need to bypass FRP, you may need to contact Vivo customer support or follow authorized methods for FRP bypass, which usually involve verifying your Google account credentials.

### 2\. What is the emergency code for FRP bypass?

There is no official emergency code for bypassing FRP on Vivo or other Android devices. FRP is a critical security feature implemented by device manufacturers to protect users' data. To bypass FRP, you must follow the legitimate procedure provided by Vivo or seek professional assistance.

### 3\. How to remove screen lock in Vivo mobile?

Unlocking your Vivo mobile's screen with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is a seamless solution. Unlike hard resetting, which often leads to FRP lock issues, Dr.Fone provides a faster and safer alternative. This [Vivo Unlock Tool](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/oppo-password-unlock-tool.html) swiftly bypasses the lock screen without requiring a password, ensuring a secure and efficient process.

### 4\. How to remove an admin in Vivo ?

To remove an admin, or a device administrator:

- **Step 1.** Go to 'Settings' on your Vivo device.
- **Step 2.** Scroll down and tap on 'Security'.
- **Step 3.** Then, select 'Device Administrators' or 'Device Admin Apps'.
- **Step 4.** You will see a list of apps with administrator privileges. Find the admin you want to remove and toggle off its access.
- **Step 5.** Confirm by tapping 'Deactivate' when prompted.

### 5\. How to disable Vivo security?

Disabling security features like passwords, PINs, pattern locks, or biometric scans can be done through settings:

- **Step 1.** Open 'Settings' and go to 'Security'.
- **Step 2.** Tap on 'Passcode', 'Biometrics & Passcode', or a similar option depending on your device model.
- **Step 3.** Choose the lock method currently in use and select 'None' or 'Disable'.

**Note:** Disabling security features makes your device more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
