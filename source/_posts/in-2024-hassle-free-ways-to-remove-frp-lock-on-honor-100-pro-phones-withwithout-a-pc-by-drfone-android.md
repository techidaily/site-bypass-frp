## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 100 Pro FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor 100 Pro FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor 100 Pro FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.
