## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Honor 90 Phones with/without a PC

## Part 1: What’s Honor 90 FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 90 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 90 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 90 device.

The ****Honor 90 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 90 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 90 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 90 device. In essence, the Honor 90 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor 90 device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor 90 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor 90 FRP Code

#### Get the FRP Code

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup
