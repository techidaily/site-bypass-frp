These included built-in Honor tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Honor smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Honor 90 FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Honor 90 FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
