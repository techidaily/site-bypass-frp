### What is Honor X9b FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X9b by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X9b device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X9b device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X9b device.

### Purpose of Honor X9b FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X9b FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X9b device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X9b device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X9b device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor X9b FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X9b device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X9b after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X9b device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X9b FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Honor X9b FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor X9b is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Honor X9b FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Honor X9b to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Honor X9b and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Honor X9b to your computer.
