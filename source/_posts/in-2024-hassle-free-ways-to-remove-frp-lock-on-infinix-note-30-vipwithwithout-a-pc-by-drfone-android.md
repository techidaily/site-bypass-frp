- You will have complete access to your Infinix  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.

### What is Infinix Note 30 VIP FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Note 30 VIP by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30 VIP device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Note 30 VIP device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Note 30 VIP device.

### Purpose of Infinix Note 30 VIP FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Note 30 VIP FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Note 30 VIP device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Note 30 VIP device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Note 30 VIP device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
