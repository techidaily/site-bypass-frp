Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Itel FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP.

## How To Bypass Itel P55 5G FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Itel P55 5G FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Itel P55 5G users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

To unlock the Itel P55 5G smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Itel P55 5G FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Itel P55 5G FRP

Itel P55 5G devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel P55 5G device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
