## Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Phones with/without a PC

“I just bought a used **Samsung** device from the mobile market without checking the already signed in Google account, and I don't even know what Gmail ID is added to this device, so I'm looking for **FRP Samsung** bypass tools. Please help.” A user says so on Quora.

In all such and similar situations when you have authorized access to your Samsung  or any other Android device, but not the right Google credentials, the need for a tool that can bypass the lock arises. The content below will take you through these **FRP bypass Samsung** tools.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Samsung ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Samsung  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Samsung  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.
