## Part 4: How To Bypass Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)

- Your Android device's FRP lock will be removed following the execution of the commands.

## Part 5: How To Disable FRP Honor 70 Lite 5G?

Disabling FRP on Honor 70 Lite 5G/Poco devices is relatively simple. Once you've removed the Google account from your device, the FRP lock will be disabled, and you'll no longer need to bypass **Honor FRP**.

- Go to "Settings" from the menu.
- Go down the page and click "Accounts & Sync."

![disable frp step 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-21.jpg)

- To delete a Google account, tap on it.
- Confirm your selection of "Remove Account" by clicking.

![disable frp step 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-22.jpg)

- You might be asked to enter your device password or PIN to finish the process.
