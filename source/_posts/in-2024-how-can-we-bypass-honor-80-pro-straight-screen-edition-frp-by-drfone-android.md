## How Can We Bypass Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP?

Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Honor FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Honor .

## Part 1: What is Honor FRP Bypass Code?

You can enter the **Honor FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds.

Since many Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP

Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device again.
