Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone. When you reset your device, the FRP asks for Google verification. The FRP lock doesn't allow device access without your Google account and password. You can enter the **Honor FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds. The English **Honor FRP** **code** is \*#813#, and the Chinese code is \*#812#. You can learn how to use these codes from our step-by-step guide.

## Conclusion

The **GSM Flasher ADB Bypasser FRP tool** offers a cost-free and versatile solution to bypass FRP locks on a range of Android devices. While it provides an effective means to unlock your device, you might need to consider its compatibility, potential legal implications, and the learning curve associated with its usage.

As an alternative, tools like Dr.Fone can be explored for additional compatibility and ease of use. And, of course, the choice between these tools depends on your preferences and specific device requirements.
