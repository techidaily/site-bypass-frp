Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Honor FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP.

You can enter the **Honor FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.
