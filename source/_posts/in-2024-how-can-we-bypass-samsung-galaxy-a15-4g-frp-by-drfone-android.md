Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device.

After a factory reset, the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device.

### Significance of FRP

This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device's security measures.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Samsung smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.
