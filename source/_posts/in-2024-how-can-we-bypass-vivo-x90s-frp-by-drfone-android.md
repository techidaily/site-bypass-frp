### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Vivo X90S device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Vivo X90S device.

After a factory reset, the Vivo X90S device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Vivo X90S device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Vivo X90S device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Vivo X90S device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Vivo FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Vivo before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Vivo X90S device. While using your Vivo with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Vivo X90S device Adequately

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Vivo X90S FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Vivo X90S FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Vivo tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Vivo smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Vivo X90S FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Vivo X90S FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
