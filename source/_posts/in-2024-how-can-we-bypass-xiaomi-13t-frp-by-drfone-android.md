One of the easiest and most basic ways of bypassing the FRP lock is by enabling the safe mode on your mobile and proceeding with a factory reset of all the settings.

Once everything is related, the settings will be restored to their original form or the default value. This will allow you to have unhindered access to the Xiaomi 13T device, as the FRP lock will get disabled due to settings reset.
