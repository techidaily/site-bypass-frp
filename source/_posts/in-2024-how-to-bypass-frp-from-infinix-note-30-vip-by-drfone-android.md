## Part 2: Infinix Note 30 VIP FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Infinix Note 30 VIP Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Infinix Note 30 VIP users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Infinix Note 30 VIP:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Infinix Note 30 VIP and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Infinix Note 30 VIP device.
