Poco X5 Pro devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.
