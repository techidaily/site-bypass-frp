It is also included on the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device.

### Purpose of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device.
