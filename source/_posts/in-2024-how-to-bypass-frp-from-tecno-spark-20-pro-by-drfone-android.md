## 2.1 How to Bypass Google Account on Tecno without PC?

If you are looking for a solution to bypass Google Account on your Tecno device without a PC, there are 4 ways that will work as decent solutions. These methods all have their limitations, you can choose the one that is most suitable for you.

One of the easiest and most basic ways of bypassing the FRP lock is by enabling the safe mode on your mobile and proceeding with a factory reset of all the settings. This will erase the data, especially the current Google account, which is incorporated within the phone. Once everything is related, the settings will be restored to their original form or the default value. This will allow you to have unhindered access to the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device, as the FRP lock will get disabled due to settings reset.
