This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Vivo Y78t FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo Y78t FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo Y78t FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo Y78t FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo Y78t:

![bypass Vivo Y78t frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo Y78t FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y78t by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y78t device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y78t device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y78t device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y78t FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y78t FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y78t device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y78t device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y78t device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y78t FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y78t device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y78t after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y78t device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 3: Vivo Y78t FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Vivo Y78t Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Vivo Y78t Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Vivo Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

- **Step 3.** Choose “Permissions” and tap the “Search” icon at the top-right corner of the follow-up screen. Search for “Settings” and pick the respective app from the results list. Tap "Open" to access the Settings application. This action will direct you to the “Settings” interface.

- **Step 6.** Open the XShare APK on your second Android device. Navigate to the downloaded apps and tap “Send.” Return to the FRP phone and select “Receive” on it. Scan the QR code to establish a connection between the Vivo Y78t devices. Verify on your FRP phone that both FRP APK files have been received and proceed with the installation.
