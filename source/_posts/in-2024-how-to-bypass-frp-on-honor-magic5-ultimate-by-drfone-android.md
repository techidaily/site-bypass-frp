## AddROM Bypass: An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Honor Magic5 Ultimate

Are you an Android user? Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.

Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don't know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.

However, in most cases, users don't remember their Google ID and password. This is where ****AddROM** Bypass** steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.

But before starting, let’s learn about **AddROM**!

## Part 1. What is AddROM?

**AddROM** is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.

![Official logo of addROM.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-01.png)

But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Honor Magic5 Ultimate device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

**Step 7:** Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner. Click the "**Brower sign-in**" option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.

After a restart, you won't get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.
