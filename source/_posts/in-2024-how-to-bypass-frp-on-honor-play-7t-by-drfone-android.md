## Part 5: How To Disable FRP Honor Play 7T?

Disabling FRP on Honor Play 7T/Poco devices is relatively simple. Once you've removed the Google account from your device, the FRP lock will be disabled, and you'll no longer need to bypass **Honor FRP**.

- Go to "Settings" from the menu.
- Go down the page and click "Accounts & Sync."

- To delete a Google account, tap on it.
- Confirm your selection of "Remove Account" by clicking.

![disable frp step 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-22.jpg)

- You might be asked to enter your device password or PIN to finish the process.

## Summary

In conclusion, unlocking Honor Play 7T FRP can be difficult, but it can be done quickly with the correct tools. You can either use the traditional method, which may prove quite long. We would recommend using the **Honor FRP bypass tool**. The top Honor Play 7T Google FRP Unlock tools, such as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/), have been covered in this article. Since Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is an all-in-one solution for Samsung, Xiaomi, Redmi, Oppo, Realme, Vivo FRP unlocking, we advise readers to give it a try.
