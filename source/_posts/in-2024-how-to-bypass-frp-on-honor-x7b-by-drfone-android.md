Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Honor uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Honor X7b device would be able to access the Honor X7b device. This aids in preventing the Honor X7b device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Honor X7b devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Honor X7b FRP** challenges with our complete method.

We have included more than two ways to unlock your mobile without any hassle and complication. Just follow this guide, and you will regain access to your device in no time.

**Precautions:**

- **Backup Your Data:** In order to prevent data loss during FRP bypass, be sure to back up all vital information from your smartphone, including contacts, pictures, videos, and documents, to a secure location.
- **Charge the battery:** To prevent any delays during the FRP bypass procedure, ensure your device has enough battery life or is connected to a charger.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Honor X7b FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)

- Your Android device's FRP lock will be removed following the execution of the commands.

## Part 5: How To Disable FRP Honor X7b?
