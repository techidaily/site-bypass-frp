## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor X9a device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor X9a device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X9a device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor X9a device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor X9a device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor X9a device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor X9a FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor X9a FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor X9a FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor X9a:

![bypass Honor X9a frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor X9a FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X9a by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X9a device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X9a device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X9a device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Honor X9a FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X9a FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X9a device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X9a device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X9a device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Honor X9a FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X9a device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X9a after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X9a device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X9a FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Honor X9a FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:
