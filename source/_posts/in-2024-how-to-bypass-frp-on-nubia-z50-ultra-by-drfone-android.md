The above is the brief steps for the process. You can check the [bypass Samsung FRP lock guide](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/google-frp-bypass.html) in detail.


## Conclusion

If you are well versed with the commands of ADB and Fastboots you can go ahead and use the **ADB bypass FRP tool** for removing the FRP lock but if this command line method seems complicated for you, Dr.Fone Screen Unlock is the best tool to use.
