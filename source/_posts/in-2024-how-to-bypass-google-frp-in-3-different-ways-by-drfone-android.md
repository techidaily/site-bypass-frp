## How To Bypass Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP In 3 Different Ways

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Google Pixel 8 Pro device again.

![bypass Google Pixel 8 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Google Pixel 8 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Google Pixel 8 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Google Pixel 8 Pro device.

### Purpose of Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Google Pixel 8 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Google Pixel 8 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Google Pixel 8 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Google Pixel 8 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
