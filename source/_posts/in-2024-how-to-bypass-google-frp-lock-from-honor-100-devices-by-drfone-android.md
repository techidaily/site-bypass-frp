## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Honor 100 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Honor 100 smartphones.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor 100 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor 100 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor 100 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor 100 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor 100 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor 100 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor 100:

![bypass Honor 100 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor 100 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 100 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 100 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 100 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 100 device.

### Purpose of Honor 100 FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 100 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 100 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 100 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 100 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor 100 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 100 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 100 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 100 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor 100 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor 100 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment
