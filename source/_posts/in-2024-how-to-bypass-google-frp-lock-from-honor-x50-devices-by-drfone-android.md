## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Honor X50 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Honor X50 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Honor X50 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 1: What’s Honor X50 FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor X50 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor X50 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor X50 device.

The ****Honor X50 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor X50 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor X50 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor X50 device. In essence, the Honor X50 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor X50 device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor X50 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor X50 FRP Code

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup
