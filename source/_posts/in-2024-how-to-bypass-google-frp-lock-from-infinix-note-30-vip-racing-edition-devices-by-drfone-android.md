## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone.

Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.

A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.
