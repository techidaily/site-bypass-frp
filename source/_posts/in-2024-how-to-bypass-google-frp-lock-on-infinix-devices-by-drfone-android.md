## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 Plus phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### How it works?

Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you'll need your phone's Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we'll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Infinix Smart 8 Plus .
