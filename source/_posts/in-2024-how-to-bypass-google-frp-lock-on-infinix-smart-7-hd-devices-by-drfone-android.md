## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Infinix Smart 7 HD phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 1\. What is the FRP skip code for Infinix ?

Currently, there is no universally applicable "FRP skip code" for Infinix devices. FRP is a security feature, designed to prevent unauthorized access to your device after a factory reset. If you are the legitimate owner and need to bypass FRP, you may need to contact Infinix customer support or follow authorized methods for FRP bypass, which usually involve verifying your Google account credentials.

### 2\. What is the emergency code for FRP bypass?

There is no official emergency code for bypassing FRP on Infinix or other Android devices. FRP is a critical security feature implemented by device manufacturers to protect users' data. To bypass FRP, you must follow the legitimate procedure provided by Infinix or seek professional assistance.

### 3\. How to remove screen lock in Infinix mobile?

Unlocking your Infinix mobile's screen with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is a seamless solution.

### 5\. How to disable Infinix security?

Disabling security features like passwords, PINs, pattern locks, or biometric scans can be done through settings:

- **Step 1.** Open 'Settings' and go to 'Security'.
- **Step 2.** Tap on 'Passcode', 'Biometrics & Passcode', or a similar option depending on your device model.
- **Step 3.** Choose the lock method currently in use and select 'None' or 'Disable'.
