## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Itel S23 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Itel S23 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Itel S23 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Itel S23 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Itel S23 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Itel S23 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel S23 FRP

### What is Itel S23 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel S23 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel S23 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel S23 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel S23 device.

### Purpose of Itel S23 FRP

The primary purpose of Itel S23 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel S23 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel S23 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel S23 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Itel S23 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel S23 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel S23 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel S23 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel S23 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Itel S23 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel S23 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Itel S23 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Itel S23 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Itel S23 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Itel S23 to your computer.
