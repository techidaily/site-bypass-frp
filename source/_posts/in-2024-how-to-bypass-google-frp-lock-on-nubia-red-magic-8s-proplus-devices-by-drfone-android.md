## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device.

After a factory reset, the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device.

While using your Nubia with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Nubia device to at least 50%.
