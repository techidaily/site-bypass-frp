## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Realme V30 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Realme V30 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Realme V30 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between.

## Part 1: What’s Realme V30 FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Realme V30 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Realme V30 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Realme V30 device.

The ****Realme V30 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme V30 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme V30 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme V30 device. In essence, the Realme V30 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Realme V30 device, providing additional protection. Each [Realme device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Realme V30 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Realme smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Realme V30 FRP Code

To use the Realme V30 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Realme smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Realme customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Realme model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Realme smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Realme V30 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Realme V30 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
