## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device.

### Purpose of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
