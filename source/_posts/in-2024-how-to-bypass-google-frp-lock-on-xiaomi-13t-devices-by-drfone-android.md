## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Xiaomi 13T Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices. The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Xiaomi 13T smartphones.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Xiaomi 13T device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi 13T device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi 13T phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Xiaomi 13T Phone?

## Part 1: What’s Xiaomi 13T FRP Code and How To Use It

Xiaomi smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Xiaomi 13T device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Xiaomi 13T device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Xiaomi 13T device.

The ****Xiaomi 13T FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Xiaomi 13T device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Xiaomi 13T device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Xiaomi 13T device. In essence, the Xiaomi 13T FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 13T device, providing additional protection. Each [Xiaomi device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html)possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Xiaomi 13T device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Xiaomi smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Xiaomi 13T FRP Code

To use the Xiaomi 13T FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Xiaomi smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Xiaomi customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Xiaomi model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Xiaomi smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Xiaomi 13T device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Xiaomi 13T device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Xiaomi 13T FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Xiaomi smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.
