## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)
