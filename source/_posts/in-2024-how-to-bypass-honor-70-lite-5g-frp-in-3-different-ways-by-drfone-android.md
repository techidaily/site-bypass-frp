### Activation Methods of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 70 Lite 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 70 Lite 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 70 Lite 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:
