To unlock the Infinix Smart 7 HD smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

Infinix Smart 7 HD devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Infinix Smart 7 HD device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Infinix Smart 7 HD device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Infinix phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Infinix FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Infinix phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Infinix FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Infinix phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Infinix phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Infinix FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Infinix phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Smart 7 HD device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 7 HD after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 7 HD device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Infinix Smart 7 HD is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Infinix Smart 7 HD to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Infinix Smart 7 HD and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Infinix Smart 7 HD to your computer.
