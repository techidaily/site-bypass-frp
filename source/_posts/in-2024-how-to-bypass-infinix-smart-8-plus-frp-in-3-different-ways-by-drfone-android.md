## Part 3: FAQ for Bypassing Infinix FRP (Factory Reset Protection)

Below you'll find answers to some of the most common questions regarding bypassing Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on Infinix devices.

### 1\. What is the FRP skip code for Infinix ?

Currently, there is no universally applicable "FRP skip code" for Infinix devices. FRP is a security feature, designed to prevent unauthorized access to your device after a factory reset. If you are the legitimate owner and need to bypass FRP, you may need to contact Infinix customer support or follow authorized methods for FRP bypass, which usually involve verifying your Google account credentials.

### 2\. What is the emergency code for FRP bypass?

There is no official emergency code for bypassing FRP on Infinix or other Android devices. FRP is a critical security feature implemented by device manufacturers to protect users' data. To bypass FRP, you must follow the legitimate procedure provided by Infinix or seek professional assistance.

### 3\. How to remove screen lock in Infinix mobile?

Unlocking your Infinix mobile's screen with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is a seamless solution. Unlike hard resetting, which often leads to FRP lock issues, Dr.Fone provides a faster and safer alternative.

- **Step 2.** Scroll down and tap on 'Security'.

- **Step 4.** You will see a list of apps with administrator privileges. Find the admin you want to remove and toggle off its access.
- **Step 5.** Confirm by tapping 'Deactivate' when prompted.

### 5\. How to disable Infinix security?

Disabling security features like passwords, PINs, pattern locks, or biometric scans can be done through settings:

- **Step 1.** Open 'Settings' and go to 'Security'.
- **Step 2.** Tap on 'Passcode', 'Biometrics & Passcode', or a similar option depending on your device model.
- **Step 3.** Choose the lock method currently in use and select 'None' or 'Disable'.

**Note:** Disabling security features makes your device more vulnerable to unauthorized access.
