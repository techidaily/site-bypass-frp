![what is Itel frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Itel before backing up your data.

## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Itel?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Itel A60s device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Itel smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Itel A60s device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Itel A60s device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Itel A60s device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Itel A60s device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Itel. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Itel A60s device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## Part 2: 8 Ways to bypass Google locks on Itel phone

Although the factory reset protection program and the lock are beneficial to keep your device safe from other people's hands, sometimes it can cause problems for you also. For example, if you forget the Google account credentials, you won't be allowed to access a device due to the activation of the FRP lock.

That's why it's better to use the bypassing concept of FRP lock in your Itel phone. The following section will introduce you to the best and result-oriented methods for bypassing the Google lock and paving the way for unrestricted access to the Itel A60s device and system.
