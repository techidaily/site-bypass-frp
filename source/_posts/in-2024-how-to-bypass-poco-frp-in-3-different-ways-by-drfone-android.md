## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

Poco M6 Pro 4G devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Poco M6 Pro 4G device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Poco M6 Pro 4G device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

![bypass Poco M6 Pro 4G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco M6 Pro 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco M6 Pro 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco M6 Pro 4G device.

### Purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco M6 Pro 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco M6 Pro 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco M6 Pro 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco M6 Pro 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco M6 Pro 4G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
