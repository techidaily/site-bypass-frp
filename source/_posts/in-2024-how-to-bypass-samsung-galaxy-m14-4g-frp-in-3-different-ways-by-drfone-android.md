#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Samsung phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Samsung Android 11 without PC

Now that you have all the reasons to bypass **FRP on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G** or any other model, let me introduce you to the best method to avoid this feature without a PC. [TechnoCare APK](https://www.technocareapk.com/) is an Android software that allows Samsung users to bypass FRP on any Samsung brand. It's straightforward; this app lets you create another Google Account on your locked Samsung phone without unlocking it. In short, you'll link a new Google Account with a password that you can easily remember.

#### TechnoCare APK Features

- Install custom ROMs on Samsung.
- No registration is required.
- No age restrictions to use.
- User-friendly and quick FRP unlock.

- **Step 3:** Play the video on the “Getting Started” screen. Then, tap the three dots before clicking the Share > Google Plus icon.
- **Step 4:** YouTube will open where you'll tap “Terms and Privacy Policy” to open the Google browser. Here, click Bookmarks and then tap History.
- **Step 5:** The Download History will open with File Manager, where you'll click My Files and then choose SD card.

- **Step 10:** Go to Device Administrator and enable Android Device Manager.

- **Step 12:** Lastly, restart the locked phone and enjoy the services.

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Samsung Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Samsung, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Samsung

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Samsung Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Samsung and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
