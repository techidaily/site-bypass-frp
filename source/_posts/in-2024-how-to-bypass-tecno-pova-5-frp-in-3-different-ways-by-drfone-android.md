Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

1. **Back-Up Data:** Before attempting any bypass method, back up your important data because it will prevent accidental loss during the process.
2. **Verify Official Methods:** Always focus on official methods, such as using Google account credentials. They are better than third-party tools or combination files.
3. **Use Reputable Sources:** If you opt for alternative tools or methods, download them from reputable sources. It will help you avoid malware or security risks.
4. **Read User Reviews:** If using third-party tools, read user reviews and forums. This will help you gauge their effectiveness and safety.
