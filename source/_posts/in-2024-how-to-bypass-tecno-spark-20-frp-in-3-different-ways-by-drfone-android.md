## How To Bypass Tecno Spark 20 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Tecno Spark 20 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Tecno Spark 20 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Tecno Spark 20 device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Tecno Spark 20 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Tecno Spark 20 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Tecno Spark 20 FRP

Tecno Spark 20 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Tecno Spark 20 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Tecno Spark 20 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass Tecno Spark 20 FRP With 3 Easy Methods

## Ultimate Guide on Tecno Spark 20 FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Tecno phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Tecno Spark 20 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Tecno FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Tecno phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Tecno Spark 20 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Tecno FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Tecno phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Tecno phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Tecno FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Tecno phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._
