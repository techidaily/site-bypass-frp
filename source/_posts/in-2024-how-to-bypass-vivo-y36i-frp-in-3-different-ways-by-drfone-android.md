## How To Bypass Vivo Y36i FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Vivo Y36i FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y36i device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Vivo Y36i device again.
