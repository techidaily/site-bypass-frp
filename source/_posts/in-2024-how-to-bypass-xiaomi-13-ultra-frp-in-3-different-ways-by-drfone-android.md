## How To Bypass Xiaomi 13 Ultra FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Xiaomi 13 Ultra FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Xiaomi 13 Ultra device again.

## Part 5. FRP Hijacker by Hagard or Wondershare Dr.Fone: Which Is Better?

Now faced with the choice between **FRP Hijacker by Hagard** and Wondershare Dr.Fone, it becomes important to determine which tool aligns best with your specific requirements. Both options promise FRP bypass capabilities, yet they differ in their costs, ease of use, compatibility, and security measures.

Let's delve deeper into each tool's strengths and weaknesses.

|  | **Hijacker by Hagard** | **Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple and straightforward | Intuitive design with a guided process |
| Security Measures | Using vulnerabilities in the Android operating system to bypass FRP | High encryption and protection measures during the FRP unlocking process |
| Compatibility | Primarily for Samsung devices | Compatible with a wide range of Android and iOS devices. |
| Cost | Generally free | Paid software with a free trial |
| Support and Updates | Limited support; updates may vary | Strong customer support; regular updates |

## Conclusion

**FRP Hijacker by Hagard** presents itself as a targeted solution, particularly effective for Samsung devices. Its simplicity and specialized approach make it an appealing option for users who prioritize ease of use and have Samsung smartphones. However, it's important to note that its effectiveness is confined to Samsung devices, and users should consider this limitation when making a decision.

For those using Android devices other than Samsung or desiring a more versatile solution, Dr.Fone's Screen Unlock tool proves effective and easy to use. Just pick the one that matches your device and preferences for a smooth FRP unlocking experience.
