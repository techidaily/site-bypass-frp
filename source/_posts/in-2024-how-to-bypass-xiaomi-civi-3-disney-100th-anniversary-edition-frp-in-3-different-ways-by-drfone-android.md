## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP

Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
