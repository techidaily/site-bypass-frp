## How To Bypass Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

To unlock the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP

Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

#### Pros

- Does not require any money
- The fastest and most straightforward process of bypassing
