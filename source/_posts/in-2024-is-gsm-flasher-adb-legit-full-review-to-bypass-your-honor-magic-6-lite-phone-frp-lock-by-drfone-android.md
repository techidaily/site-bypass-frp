### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Magic 6 Lite device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

## Part 2: Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Honor Magic 6 Lite Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Honor Magic 6 Lite users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Honor Magic 6 Lite:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Honor Magic 6 Lite and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Honor Magic 6 Lite device.
