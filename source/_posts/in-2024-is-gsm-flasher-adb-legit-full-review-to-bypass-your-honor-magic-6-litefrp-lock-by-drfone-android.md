## Part 1: What’s Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Magic 6 Lite device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Magic 6 Lite device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Magic 6 Lite device.

The ****Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Magic 6 Lite device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Magic 6 Lite device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. In essence, the Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 Lite device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP Code

To use the Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

At this point, the Honor Magic 6 Lite device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor Magic 6 Lite device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock.
