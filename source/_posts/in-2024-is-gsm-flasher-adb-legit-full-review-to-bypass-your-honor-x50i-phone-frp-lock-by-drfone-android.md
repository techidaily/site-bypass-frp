This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor X50i device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor X50i device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

### 1\. Reset all your settings in Safe Mode

One of the easiest and most basic ways of bypassing the FRP lock is by enabling the safe mode on your mobile and proceeding with a factory reset of all the settings. This will erase the data, especially the current Google account, which is incorporated within the phone. Once everything is related, the settings will be restored to their original form or the default value. This will allow you to have unhindered access to the Honor X50i device, as the FRP lock will get disabled due to settings reset.
