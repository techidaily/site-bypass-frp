### What is Poco C50 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco C50 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco C50 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco C50 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco C50 device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Poco C50 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco C50 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco C50 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco C50 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco C50 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco C50 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco C50 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco C50 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco C50 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
