## Part 1: What’s Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Realme 12 Pro 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Realme 12 Pro 5G device.

The ****Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 12 Pro 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 12 Pro 5G device. In essence, the Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device, providing additional protection.
