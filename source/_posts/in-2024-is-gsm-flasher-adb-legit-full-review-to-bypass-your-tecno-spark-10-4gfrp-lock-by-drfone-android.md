### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials.

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone.

It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
