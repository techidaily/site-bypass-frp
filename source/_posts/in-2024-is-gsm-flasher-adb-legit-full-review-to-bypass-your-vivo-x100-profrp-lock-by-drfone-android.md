### What is Vivo X100 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo X100 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo X100 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo X100 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo X100 Pro device.

### Purpose of Vivo X100 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo X100 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo X100 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo X100 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo X100 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Vivo X100 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo X100 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo X100 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo X100 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 1: What’s Vivo X100 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo X100 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo X100 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo X100 Pro device.

The ****Vivo X100 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo X100 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo X100 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo X100 Pro device. In essence, the Vivo X100 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo X100 Pro device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo X100 Pro device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Vivo X100 Pro FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Vivo smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Vivo X100 Pro device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo X100 Pro device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
