### What is Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device to the user's Google account.
