In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Itel A60s FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel A60s FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel A60s FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel A60s FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel A60s:

![bypass Itel A60s frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Itel A60s FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel A60s by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel A60s device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel A60s device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel A60s device.

### Purpose of Itel A60s FRP

The primary purpose of Itel A60s FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel A60s device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel A60s device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel A60s device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel A60s FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel A60s device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel A60s after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel A60s device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.
