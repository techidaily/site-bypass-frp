## Part 1: What’s Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Magic 6 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

The ****Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Magic 6 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. In essence, the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

## Part 2: Definition of Honor Magic 6 Pro  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
