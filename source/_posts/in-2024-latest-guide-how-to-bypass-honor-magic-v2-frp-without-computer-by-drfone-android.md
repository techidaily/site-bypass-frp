Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Magic V2 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Magic V2 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Magic V2 device.

The ****Honor Magic V2 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Magic V2 device after it has been reset.
