## Part 1: What’s Itel A05s FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel A05s device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel A05s device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel A05s device.

The ****Itel A05s FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel A05s device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel A05s device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel A05s device. In essence, the Itel A05s FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel A05s device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel A05s device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Itel A05s FRP Code

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Itel A05s device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel A05s device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Itel A05s FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone.
