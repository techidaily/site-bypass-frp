## Part 1: What’s Itel A60s FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel A60s device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel A60s device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel A60s device.

The ****Itel A60s FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel A60s device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel A60s device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel A60s device. In essence, the Itel A60s FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel A60s device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel A60s device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Itel A60s FRP Code

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Itel A60s device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel A60s device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### What is Itel A60s FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel A60s by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel A60s device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel A60s device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel A60s device.

### Purpose of Itel A60s FRP

The primary purpose of Itel A60s FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel A60s device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel A60s device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel A60s device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Itel A60s FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel A60s device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel A60s after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel A60s device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Itel A60s device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Itel A60s device.

After a factory reset, the Itel A60s device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Itel A60s device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Itel A60s device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Itel A60s device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Itel FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Itel smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Itel before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Itel A60s device. While using your Itel with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Itel A60s device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Itel device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

Before we lead into an assessment of the tips that one can follow to avoid issues with their Itel FRP bypass process, it is necessary to guide users with the problems involving the process. However, along with the issues, all the required solutions are associated with them.

#### 1\. Faulty USB Connection

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Itel device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Itel device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.
