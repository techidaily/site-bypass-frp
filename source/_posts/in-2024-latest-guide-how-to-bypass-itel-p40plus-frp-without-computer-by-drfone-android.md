## Part 1: What’s Itel P40+ FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P40+ device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P40+ device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P40+ device.

The ****Itel P40+ FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P40+ device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P40+ device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P40+ device. In essence, the Itel P40+ FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P40+ device, providing additional protection.
