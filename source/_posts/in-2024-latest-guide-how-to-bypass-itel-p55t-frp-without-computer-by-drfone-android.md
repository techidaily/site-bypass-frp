## Part 1: What’s Itel P55T FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P55T device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P55T device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P55T device.

The ****Itel P55T FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P55T device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P55T device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P55T device. In essence, the Itel P55T FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P55T device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel P55T device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Itel P55T FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P55T device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Itel P55T device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn't guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn't work on your device. Choosing other [<u> FRP bypass software</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html) with a higher success rate can save you time.

Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills. If you're comfortable with downloading APK, Pangu can work. But if you prefer ease of use, broader device compatibility, and safety, consider dedicated tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock (Android).
