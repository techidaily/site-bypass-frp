To regain full access to the Itel S23+ device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel S23+ device.

The ****Itel S23+ FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel S23+ device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel S23+ device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel S23+ device. In essence, the Itel S23+ FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
