While the software solution is the best option for **Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
