## Part 3: How to Disable FRP lock on Samsung Tecno Spark 10 Pro?

To avoid the stress of bypassing FRP on your Samsung phone in the future, you may have to disable Android Lock altogether. This is a relatively straightforward procedure on any Android phone you use. But be guided that turning off FRP on your Tecno Spark 10 Pro phone is not recommended.

Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Search for the Settings app and open it.
- **Step 2:** Next, click Accounts and backup before clicking Accounts.
- **Step 3:** You'll see all the linked email accounts. Choose the one that you want to delete.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and then click Remove Account once again to confirm. That's it!

## Conclusion

See, you can quickly bypass FRP on Tecno Spark 10 Pro with these methods. But remember that disabling FRP will leave your phone without security protection. Also, bypassing FRP using the YouTube method can be lengthy and complex. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to skip FRP on Android 6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13. Give it a try!
