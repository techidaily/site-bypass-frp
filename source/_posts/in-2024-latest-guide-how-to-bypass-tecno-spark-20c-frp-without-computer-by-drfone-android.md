## Part 1: What’s Tecno Spark 20C FRP Code and How To Use It

Tecno smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Tecno Spark 20C device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Tecno Spark 20C device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Tecno Spark 20C device.

The ****Tecno Spark 20C FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Tecno Spark 20C device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Tecno Spark 20C device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Tecno Spark 20C device. In essence, the Tecno Spark 20C FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20C device, providing additional protection. Each [Tecno device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Tecno Spark 20C device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Tecno smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Tecno smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Tecno Spark 20C device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Tecno Spark 20C device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Tecno uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Tecno Spark 20C device would be able to access the Tecno Spark 20C device. This aids in preventing the Tecno Spark 20C device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Tecno Spark 20C devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.
