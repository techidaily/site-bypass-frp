Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Vivo V27 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo V27 device.

The ****Vivo V27 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo V27 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo V27 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo V27 device. In essence, the Vivo V27 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo V27 device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo V27 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.
