![what is Vivo frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Vivo X100 device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Vivo X100 device.

After a factory reset, the Vivo X100 device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Vivo X100 device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Vivo X100 device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Vivo X100 device's security measures.

It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Vivo before backing up your data.

The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Vivo X100 users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Vivo X100:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Vivo X100 and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Vivo X100 device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Vivo X100 device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

- **Step 3.** After pressing "Emergency," tap "Emergency Information" on the next screen. On the "Owner" screen, tap the icon at the top right corner, enter the SIM PIN code, and when asked, choose "Add contact."

![proceed to add contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-6.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Add the contact you saved as the owner's contact and make a call. During the call, tap "Contacts" to access your saved contacts, and select the one you saved. On tapping the three dots on the top, select "Share” and choose "Share as text."

![select and share saved contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-7.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Choose "XShare Mini" as the sharing option, grant the necessary permissions, and leave the Vivo X100 device on the "QR Code." Move to another device and access a web browser. Go to mobileteamofficials.com and download two apps: “Google Account Manager” and “Account Login/ FRP Bypass.”

## Part 3: Vivo X100 FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Vivo X100 Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Vivo X100 Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Vivo Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Choose “Permissions” and tap the “Search” icon at the top-right corner of the follow-up screen. Search for “Settings” and pick the respective app from the results list. Tap "Open" to access the Settings application. This action will direct you to the “Settings” interface.
