Xiaomi smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Xiaomi 14 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Xiaomi 14 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Xiaomi 14 device.

The ****Xiaomi 14 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Xiaomi 14 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Xiaomi 14 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Xiaomi 14 device. In essence, the Xiaomi 14 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Xiaomi phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Xiaomi 14 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Xiaomi FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Xiaomi phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Xiaomi 14 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Xiaomi FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Xiaomi phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Xiaomi phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Xiaomi FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Xiaomi phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Xiaomi 14 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Xiaomi 14 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi 14 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi 14 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Xiaomi 14:

### What is Xiaomi 14 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi 14 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 14 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi 14 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi 14 device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi 14 FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi 14 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi 14 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi 14 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi 14 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi 14 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi 14 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi 14 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi 14 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Xiaomi 14 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Xiaomi 14 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Xiaomi 14 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Xiaomi 14 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Xiaomi 14 to your computer.
