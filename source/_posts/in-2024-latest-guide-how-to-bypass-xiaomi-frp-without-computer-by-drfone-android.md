## Part 1: What’s Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP Code and How To Use It

Xiaomi smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

The ****Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. In essence, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device, providing additional protection. Each [Xiaomi device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Xiaomi smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP Code

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Xiaomi smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Xiaomi?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Xiaomi smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Xiaomi. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
