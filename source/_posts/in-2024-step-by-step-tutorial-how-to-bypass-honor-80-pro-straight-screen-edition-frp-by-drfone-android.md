### What is Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device.

### Purpose of Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device's contents.

- **Step 3.** Once your Honor device is successfully connected, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) will automatically detect it. Follow the on-screen instructions to put your Honor device into specic mode. Once in the correct mode, Dr.Fone will start downloading the necessary firmware to bypass the FRP lock.

During the process, it's crucial to keep your device connected to the computer and refrain from disconnecting it until the bypass is complete. After the firmware download is finished, Dr.Fone will initiate the FRP lock bypass process. Once completed, your Honor device will restart, and you'll regain access to it without encountering the FRP lock.
