### What is Infinix Note 30 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Note 30 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Note 30 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Note 30 5G device.

### Purpose of Infinix Note 30 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Note 30 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Note 30 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Note 30 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Note 30 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Note 30 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Note 30 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Note 30 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Note 30 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Note 30 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Infinix Note 30 5G FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:
