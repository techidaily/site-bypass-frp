### What is Infinix Smart 8 HD FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 HD by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 HD device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 HD device to the user's Google account.
