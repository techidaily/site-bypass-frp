One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo. It is designed to safeguard the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device from unauthorized access.

This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo:

![bypass Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device.

### Purpose of Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.
