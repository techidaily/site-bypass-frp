Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Itel P55 5G has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Itel P55 5G device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Itel P55 5G. It is designed to safeguard the Itel P55 5G device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Itel P55 5G FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel P55 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel P55 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel P55 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel P55 5G:

![bypass Itel P55 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Itel P55 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P55 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P55 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P55 5G device.

### Purpose of Itel P55 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P55 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P55 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P55 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P55 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P55 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P55 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P55 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P55 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel P55 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel P55 5G is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Itel phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Itel P55 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Itel FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Itel phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Itel P55 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Itel FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Itel phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Itel phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Itel FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Itel phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 3: How to Bypass All Itel Locked Screens without Password

Unlocking FRP using TechnoCare APK is free, quick, and exciting. However, sometimes you may want to unlock your PIN, password, pattern, and other lock systems that you might have forgotten. In that case, use [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/). It's a desktop program that lets you unlock passwords, PINs, and patterns on Itel, Samsung, Nokia, OPPO, Xiaomi, and other Android phone brands.

## Part 4: How to Disable Google FRP Feature on Itel

You don't always need to Factory Reset your phone before selling it or handing it over to someone else. Instead, you can manually disable the Activation Lock feature and let the new owner Factory Reset it by themselves. Follow me:

- **Step 1:** Open Settings and then click Accounts.
- **Step 2:** Tap Google, and then you'll see all the linked Google Accounts.
- **Step 3:** Tap the Google Account you want to remove and tap the Ellipsis icon on the upper-right corner.
- **Step 4:** Click Remove Account and press Ok to erase the Gmail account. You can remove all the linked accounts if you want.

## Conclusion

And that's the best **Itel Android 11 FRP bypass** method. With TechnoCare APK, you can quickly bypass APK by adding a different Google Account with an easy-to-remember password. Also, use [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to unblock PIN, password, pattern, TouchID, and FaceID on Itel and other Android brands. And another thing, you can manually disable FRP before selling or gifting your phone away. I hope this helps!
