Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel P55+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel P55+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel P55+:

### What is Itel P55+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P55+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P55+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P55+ device.

### Purpose of Itel P55+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P55+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P55+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P55+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P55+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Itel P55+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P55+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P55+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P55+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Itel P55+ FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:
