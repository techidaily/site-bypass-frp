## Part 1: Understanding the Itel S23+ FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel S23+ FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel S23+ FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel S23+:

### What is Itel S23+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel S23+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel S23+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel S23+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel S23+ device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Itel S23+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel S23+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel S23+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel S23+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel S23+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel S23+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel S23+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel S23+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel S23+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel S23+ FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Itel S23+ FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel S23+ is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

To bypass Itel S23+ FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Itel S23+ to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Itel S23+ to your computer.

### 4\. Ensure a Stable Internet Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is vital for a smooth FRP bypass. Make sure your computer and Itel S23+ are connected to the internet throughout the process. FRP bypassing will need you to download related files to complete the procedure.

## Part 2: Itel S23+ FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Itel S23+ Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Itel S23+ users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Itel S23+:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Itel S23+ and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Itel S23+ device.

![add sim to tecno pop 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Itel S23+ device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.
