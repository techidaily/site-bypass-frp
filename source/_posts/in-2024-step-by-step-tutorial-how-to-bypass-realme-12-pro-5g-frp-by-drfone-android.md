### What is Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Realme 12 Pro 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Realme 12 Pro 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Realme 12 Pro 5G device.

### Purpose of Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Realme 12 Pro 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Realme 12 Pro 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Realme 12 Pro 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Realme 12 Pro 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Realme 12 Pro 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Realme 12 Pro 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Realme 12 Pro 5G FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:
