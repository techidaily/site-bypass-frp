FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Camon 20 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Camon 20 device.

### Purpose of Tecno Camon 20 FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Camon 20 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Camon 20 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Camon 20 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Camon 20 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
