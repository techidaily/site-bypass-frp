In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro:

![bypass Tecno Spark 20 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Tecno Spark 20 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Tecno Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Tecno Spark 20 Pro is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.
