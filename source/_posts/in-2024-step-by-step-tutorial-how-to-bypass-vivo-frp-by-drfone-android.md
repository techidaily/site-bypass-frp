### What is Vivo S18e FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo S18e by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo S18e device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo S18e device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo S18e device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Vivo S18e FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo S18e FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo S18e device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo S18e device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo S18e device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo S18e FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo S18e device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo S18e after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo S18e device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo S18e FRP

## Solutions to Bypass Vivo FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Vivo S18e .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Vivo FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Vivo S18e  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme.

## Part 2: Definition of Vivo S18e  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
