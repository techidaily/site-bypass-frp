### Purpose of Vivo X Fold 2 FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo X Fold 2 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo X Fold 2 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo X Fold 2 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo X Fold 2 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

### Activation Methods of Vivo X Fold 2 FRP

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo X Fold 2 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo X Fold 2 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
