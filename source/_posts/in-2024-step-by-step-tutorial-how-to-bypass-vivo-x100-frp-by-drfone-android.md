## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How To Bypass Vivo X100 FRP

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Vivo X100 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Vivo X100 device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Vivo X100. It is designed to safeguard the Vivo X100 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Vivo X100 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo X100 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo X100 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo X100 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo X100:

![bypass Vivo X100 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo X100 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo X100 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo X100 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo X100 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo X100 device.

### Purpose of Vivo X100 FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo X100 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo X100 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo X100 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo X100 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo X100 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo X100 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo X100 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo X100 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo X100 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo X100 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo X100 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Vivo X100 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Vivo X100 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Vivo X100 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Vivo X100 device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Vivo X100 device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Vivo smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Vivo X100 device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Vivo X100 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Vivo X100 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Vivo. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Vivo X100 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
