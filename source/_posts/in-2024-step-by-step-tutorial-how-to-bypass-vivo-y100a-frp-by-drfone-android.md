### What is Vivo Y100A FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y100A by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100A device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y100A device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y100A device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y100A FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y100A FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y100A device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y100A device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y100A device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y100A FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y100A device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y100A after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y100A device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y100A FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo Y100A FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo Y100A is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Vivo Y100A FRP

Vivo Y100A devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y100A device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Vivo Y100A device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
