### What is Vivo Y100i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y100i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y100i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y100i device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y100i FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y100i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y100i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y100i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y100i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Vivo Y100i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y100i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y100i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y100i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y100i FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Vivo Y100i FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

## Easy Guide How To Bypass Vivo Y100i FRP Android 10/11/12/13

Security measures have become increasingly robust nowadays to protect user data. One such security feature is Factory Reset Protection (FRP). This feature is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset. FRP serves its purpose of safeguarding personal information. At times it can pose a challenge for users who find themselves locked out of their own devices.

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step **Vivo FRP bypass Android 10, 11**, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you'll regain access to your Vivo smartphone even if you've forgotten the associated Google account credentials.

## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Vivo FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Vivo frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Vivo Y100i device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Vivo Y100i device.

After a factory reset, the Vivo Y100i device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Vivo Y100i device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Vivo Y100i device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Vivo Y100i device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Vivo FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Vivo smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Vivo before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Vivo Y100i device. While using your Vivo with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Vivo Y100i device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Vivo device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Vivo smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

Take note that it may take approximately 24 hours for Google to synchronize the new password across all your devices. Once the new password has been synced, you can sign into your Google account on your Vivo smartphone, successfully bypassing the FRP lock.
