This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Vivo Y27s FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo Y27s FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo Y27s FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo Y27s FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo Y27s:

![bypass Vivo Y27s frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo Y27s FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y27s by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y27s device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y27s device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y27s device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y27s FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y27s FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y27s device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y27s device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y27s device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y27s FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y27s device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y27s after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y27s device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y27s FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
