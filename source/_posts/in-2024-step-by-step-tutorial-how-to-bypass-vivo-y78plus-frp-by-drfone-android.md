### What is Vivo Y78+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y78+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y78+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y78+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y78+ device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Vivo Y78+ FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y78+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y78+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y78+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y78+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y78+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y78+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y78+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y78+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y78+ FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo Y78+ FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo Y78+ is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Vivo Y78+ FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y78+ FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Vivo Y78+ device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y78+ device.

The ****Vivo Y78+ FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y78+ device after it has been reset.

In essence, the Vivo Y78+ FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup
