## Part 1: Understanding the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free.

![bypass Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Xiaomi Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:
