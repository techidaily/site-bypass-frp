### What is Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.
