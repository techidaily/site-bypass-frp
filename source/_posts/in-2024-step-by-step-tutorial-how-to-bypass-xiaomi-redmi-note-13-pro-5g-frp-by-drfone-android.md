FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device being lost or stolen.
