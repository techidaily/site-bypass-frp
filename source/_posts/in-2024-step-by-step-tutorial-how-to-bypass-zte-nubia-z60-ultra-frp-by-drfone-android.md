### What is ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device.

### Purpose of ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP

The primary purpose of ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
