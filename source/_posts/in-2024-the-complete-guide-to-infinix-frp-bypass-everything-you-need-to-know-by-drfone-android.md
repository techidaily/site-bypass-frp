### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device.

After a factory reset, the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Infinix FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Infinix smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions.

## Part 2: Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Infinix Smart 8 Plus Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Infinix Smart 8 Plus users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Infinix Smart 8 Plus:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Infinix Smart 8 Plus and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device.
