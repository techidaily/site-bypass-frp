It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Itel P40 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.
