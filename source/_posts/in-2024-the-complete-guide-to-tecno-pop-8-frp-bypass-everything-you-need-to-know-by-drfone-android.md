## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Tecno?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Tecno Pop 8 device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Tecno smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Tecno Pop 8 device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Tecno Pop 8 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Tecno Pop 8 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Tecno Pop 8 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Tecno. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Tecno Pop 8 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
