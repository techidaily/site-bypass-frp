## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Vivo?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Vivo X100 device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Vivo smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Vivo X100 device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Vivo X100 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Vivo X100 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Vivo X100 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Vivo. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Vivo X100 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## Part 1: What’s Vivo X100 FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo X100 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo X100 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo X100 device.

The ****Vivo X100 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo X100 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo X100 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo X100 device. In essence, the Vivo X100 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
