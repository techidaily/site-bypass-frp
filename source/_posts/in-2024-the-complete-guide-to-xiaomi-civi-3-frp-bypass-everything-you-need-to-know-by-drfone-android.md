![bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Civi 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Civi 3 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Civi 3 device being lost or stolen.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Civi 3 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
