## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Xiaomi?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Xiaomi smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device.

Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device information section.
