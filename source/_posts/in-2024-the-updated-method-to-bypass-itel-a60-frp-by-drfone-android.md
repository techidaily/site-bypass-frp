[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Itel uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Itel A60 device would be able to access the Itel A60 device. This aids in preventing the Itel A60 device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Itel A60 devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Itel A60 FRP** challenges with our complete method.

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Itel A60 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel A60 device.

The ****Itel A60 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel A60 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel A60 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel A60 device. In essence, the Itel A60 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel A60 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Itel A60 FRP
