[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Itel uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Itel P40 device would be able to access the Itel P40 device. This aids in preventing the Itel P40 device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Itel P40 devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Itel P40 FRP** challenges with our complete method.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Itel P40 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Itel P40 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Itel P40 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.
