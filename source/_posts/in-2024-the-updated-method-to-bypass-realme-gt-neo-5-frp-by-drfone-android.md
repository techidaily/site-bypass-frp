## AddROM Bypass: An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Realme GT Neo 5

Are you an Android user? Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.

Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don't know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.

However, in most cases, users don't remember their Google ID and password. This is where ****AddROM** Bypass** steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.

But before starting, let’s learn about **AddROM**!

## Part 1. What is AddROM?

**AddROM** is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone.

You can enter the **Realme FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds.

### 2: Use Realme Emergency FRP Code

The Realme Emergency FRP Code is an alternative method to bypass FRP, relying on a unique code provided by the Realme GT Neo 5 device manufacturer. After you do a factory reset on your Realme smartphone, don't rush to set it up. If you set up your device, the FRP lock will appear on the screen. When you go to the language selection screen, tap on the emergency call option to open the dialer. That's where you will be entering the **Realme FRP bypass code**. Follow these steps to remove the FRP lock from your smartphone.

![bypass code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

- **Step 1.** Power on your Realme device after the factory reset.

### 3: By Talkback Method to Bypass

Before using the Talkback method, ensure that your phone has more than 50% battery backup and an internet connection. The Talkback method will not work on devices with the latest Android operating system. Here are the steps to bypass **Realme FRP** lock with the Talkback method.
