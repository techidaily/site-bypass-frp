Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Vivo uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Vivo X Flip device would be able to access the Vivo X Flip device. This aids in preventing the Vivo X Flip device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Vivo X Flip devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.
