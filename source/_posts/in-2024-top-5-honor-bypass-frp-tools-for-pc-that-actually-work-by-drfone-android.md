## Conclusion

See, you can quickly bypass FRP on Honor X9b with these methods. But remember that disabling FRP will leave your phone without security protection. Also, bypassing FRP using the YouTube method can be lengthy and complex. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to skip FRP on Android 6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13. Give it a try!
