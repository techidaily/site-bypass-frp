## Part 1: What’s Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Magic 6 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

The ****Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Magic 6 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. In essence, the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor Magic 6 Pro device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
