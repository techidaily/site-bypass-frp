Smartphones, whether iPhone or Android, are really important in our daily lives these days. They store a lot of professional and private information. To keep their users safe, smartphone companies have added different security measures. One of these security features is called Factory Reset Protection (FRP). It stops unauthorized people from getting into a phone after resetting it.

Even though this is an important security measure, it can sometimes be annoying. This is true for Honor smartphone users who can't access their phones because they forgot their login details. Fortunately, there are ways for ****Honor X7b FRP bypass without a PC****. This article will present you with the latest guide on how to [bypass Honor X7b FRP](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html).

## Part 1: What’s Honor X7b FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor X7b device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor X7b device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor X7b device.

The ****Honor X7b FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor X7b device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor X7b device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor X7b device. In essence, the Honor X7b FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor X7b device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor X7b device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor X7b FRP Code

To use the Honor X7b FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Honor customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Honor model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Honor smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Honor X7b device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor X7b device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
