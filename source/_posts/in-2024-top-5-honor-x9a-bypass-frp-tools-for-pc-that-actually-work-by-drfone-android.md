- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
