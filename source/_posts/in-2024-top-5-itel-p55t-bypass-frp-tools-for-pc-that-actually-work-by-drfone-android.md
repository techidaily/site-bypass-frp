## Easy Guide How To Bypass Itel P55T FRP Android 10/11/12/13

Security measures have become increasingly robust nowadays to protect user data. One such security feature is Factory Reset Protection (FRP). This feature is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a device after a factory reset. FRP serves its purpose of safeguarding personal information. At times it can pose a challenge for users who find themselves locked out of their own devices.

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step **Itel FRP bypass Android 10, 11**, 12, and 13 processes. By following these instructions carefully, you'll regain access to your Itel smartphone even if you've forgotten the associated Google account credentials.

## Part 1: Basic Understanding of FRP

Before going after **Itel FRP bypassing Android 12**, it is important to understand what FRP is. Knowing what it is and how it works will help you bypass this lock. Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a powerful security feature developed and implemented by Google for all Android smartphone companies. It works on Android devices starting from Android 5.1 Lollipop and above.

![what is Itel frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Itel P55T device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Itel P55T device.

After a factory reset, the Itel P55T device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Itel P55T device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Itel P55T device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Itel P55T device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Itel FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Itel smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Itel before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Itel P55T device. While using your Itel with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Itel P55T device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Itel device to at least 50%. The ideal way is to connect it to a power source during the procedure. This will prevent any unexpected shutdowns that could potentially disrupt the bypass process.

### Connecting to Stable Internet

A stable and reliable internet connection is crucial for a successful FRP bypass. Ensure your phone is connected to a secure Wi-Fi network or stable cellular data connection. A strong internet connection is required to download necessary files or tools during the FRP bypass process. By ensuring a stable connection, you'll avoid potential delays or complications.

## Part 3. Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Itel smartphone is directly linked to your Google account. The reason you find yourself in this situation is due to the inability to recall your Google account password. However, there is a solution — by recovering your Google account, you can successfully bypass the FRP lock.

This process will only work if you at least remember the Gmail ID. Follow the straightforward steps provided below to reset your Google account password:

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.

## Part 4: How To Bypass Itel P55T FRP With ADB Command on a PC?

ADB and Fastboots, which stand for Android Debug Bridge and Android Debug Bridge, respectively, are two ways that a computer can communicate with an Android smartphone. The commands and actions delivered by the system are carried out on your Android device using this technique.

Depending on the OS version, the Google FRP lock can be removed using a variety of commands using the flexible ADB command-line tool and Fastboots. This software uses a client-server architecture and a client that transmits commands.

- Download the ADB installed setup file first, and then extract the toolkit files to a folder on your computer.

![adb installer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-11.jpg)

- Run adb.setup.exe next, and then press Y to accept the prompt to install the ADB drivers.
- When the drivers have been successfully installed, type Y once more, and the command window will close.
- Next, please turn on your Android device and connect it to your PC using a USB cord. Ensure your Android device's USB debugging mode is also on here.
- Then, while holding down the Shift key, right-click somewhere that is empty in the ADB folder and select the Open command window here.
- Then, to delete the FRP, run the following lines one at a time at the command prompt, pressing enter after each line. Below is the code for CMD.

![code for cmd](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/adb-frp-command.jpg)

- Your Android device's FRP lock will be removed following the execution of the commands.

## Part 5: How To Disable FRP Itel P55T?

Disabling FRP on Itel P55T/Poco devices is relatively simple. Once you've removed the Google account from your device, the FRP lock will be disabled, and you'll no longer need to bypass **Itel FRP**.

- Go to "Settings" from the menu.
- Go down the page and click "Accounts & Sync."

![disable frp step 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-21.jpg)

- To delete a Google account, tap on it.
- Confirm your selection of "Remove Account" by clicking.

![disable frp step 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/how-to-bypass-xiaomi-redmi-frp-22.jpg)

- You might be asked to enter your device password or PIN to finish the process.
