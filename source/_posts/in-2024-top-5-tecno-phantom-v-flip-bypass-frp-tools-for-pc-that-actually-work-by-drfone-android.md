## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Tecno Phantom V Flip FRP

Tecno Phantom V Flip devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Tecno Phantom V Flip device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

- Step 4. Connect the SUB drive to the Tecno Phantom V Flip device using an OTG cable.

## Part 4. How to Delete a Google Account on Tecno after Factory Reset

Removing the FRP lock can put your device at risk if it lands into unauthorized access, but if you find hassle in remembering the Google Account details and doubt you can easily forget it, removing the associated Google account is better as it will also disable the FRP lock.

Also, if you are selling your phone or gifting it to someone, then remove the associated Google Account so that the new owner does not have any issues with the factory reset of the Tecno Phantom V Flip device.

**Steps for removing the Google Account from Tecno Phone**

- Step 1. On the phone home screen, click on the Settings icon and then look for the Passwords & Accounts option.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
