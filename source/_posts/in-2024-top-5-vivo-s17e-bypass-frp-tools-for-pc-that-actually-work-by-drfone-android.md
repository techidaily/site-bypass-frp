This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Vivo S17e FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo S17e FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo S17e FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo S17e FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo S17e:

![bypass Vivo S17e frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo S17e FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo S17e by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo S17e device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo S17e device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo S17e device.

### Purpose of Vivo S17e FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo S17e FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo S17e device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo S17e device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo S17e device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo S17e FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo S17e device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo S17e after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo S17e device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

While the software solution is the best option for **Vivo S17e Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Vivo S17e users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Vivo S17e:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Vivo S17e and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Vivo S17e device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Vivo S17e device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

- **Step 3.** After pressing "Emergency," tap "Emergency Information" on the next screen. On the "Owner" screen, tap the icon at the top right corner, enter the SIM PIN code, and when asked, choose "Add contact."

![proceed to add contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-6.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Add the contact you saved as the owner's contact and make a call. During the call, tap "Contacts" to access your saved contacts, and select the one you saved. On tapping the three dots on the top, select "Share” and choose "Share as text."

- **Step 5.** Choose "XShare Mini" as the sharing option, grant the necessary permissions, and leave the Vivo S17e device on the "QR Code." Move to another device and access a web browser. Go to mobileteamofficials.com and download two apps: “Google Account Manager” and “Account Login/ FRP Bypass.”

## Part 3: Vivo S17e FRP Bypass With APK

While you consider other FRP bypassing methods instead of Wondershare Dr.Fone, there is another option that you can go with. If you prefer a method that doesn't involve a PC or SIM card, **Vivo S17e Pro FRP bypass** using an APK is a viable option. You can follow the steps given below to complete this **Vivo S17e Lite FRP unlock tool** process:

- **Step 1.** To begin, turn on your Vivo Android 11 Phone. Press “START” and link your phone to a Wi-Fi connection. Return to the Welcome Screen, then press “Start” and choose the option to “Add a New Network.”

![start by adding network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-13.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Touch the “Microphone” icon and choose “Deny” across the pop-up. Go for the “Microphone” icon again, and opt for “Deny.” Lastly, touch the same icon again and opt for “Allow.” This will take you to the Gboard App information screen.

![workout with permissions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-tecno-pop-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-14.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Choose “Permissions” and tap the “Search” icon at the top-right corner of the follow-up screen. Search for “Settings” and pick the respective app from the results list. Tap "Open" to access the Settings application. This action will direct you to the “Settings” interface.
