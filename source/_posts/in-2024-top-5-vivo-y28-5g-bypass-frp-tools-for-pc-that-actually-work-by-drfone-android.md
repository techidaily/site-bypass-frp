![what is Vivo frp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-frp-bypass-1.jpg)

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Vivo Y28 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Vivo Y28 5G device.

After a factory reset, the Vivo Y28 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Vivo Y28 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Vivo Y28 5G device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Vivo Y28 5G device's security measures.

## Part 2. Preparing for FRP Bypass

It is crucial to make sure you're prepared before you go after the **Vivo FRP bypass the Android 13**. This section will guide you through the essential steps to ensure a successful bypass process. Following these measures will reduce the chances of encountering any obstacles. So, let's get started by taking care of a few key aspects before proceeding with the FRP bypass.

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Vivo smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions. Attempting to bypass FRP on incompatible devices may lead to unexpected results. Confirming device compatibility will ensure that the provided instructions are relevant. It will also ensure the given instructions are applicable to your specific situation.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Vivo before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Vivo Y28 5G device. While using your Vivo with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Charging the Vivo Y28 5G device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Vivo device to at least 50%.

- **Step 1**: Access the Google Sign-in page on your computer using a web browser. Enter your Google account email address. When asked for the password to add, proceed with the "Forget Password" option.
