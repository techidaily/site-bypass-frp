Before we lead into an assessment of the tips that one can follow to avoid issues with their Xiaomi FRP bypass process, it is necessary to guide users with the problems involving the process. However, along with the issues, all the required solutions are associated with them.

#### 1\. Faulty USB Connection

**Solution:** Ensure your Xiaomi device is properly connected to your computer via a USB cable. Moreover, try using a different laptop port or USB cable but confirm it is original to fix any connection-related issues.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Xiaomi device model or Android version.

**Solution:** Confirm that the FRP bypass tool you are using supports your Xiaomi device model and the specific Android version installed on your device. Consider trying an alternative tool if compatibility issues persist.

#### 4\. Network Connectivity Problems

Instability in your internet can cause issues with the downloading or verification process. As a result, your attempt to bypass FRP fails.

**Solution:** Ensure you have a stable and high-speed internet connection to avoid interruptions during the FRP bypass. If not, try switching to a different network, such as taking a mobile hotspot from your family member or friend. You can also reset your network settings if connectivity issues persist.
