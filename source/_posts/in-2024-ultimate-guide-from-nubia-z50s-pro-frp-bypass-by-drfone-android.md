## Ultimate Guide on Nubia Z50S Pro FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Nubia phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Nubia Z50S Pro FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Nubia FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Nubia phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Nubia Z50S Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Nubia FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Nubia phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Nubia FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Nubia phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

Nubia smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Nubia Z50S Pro device.

The ****Nubia Z50S Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Nubia Z50S Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Nubia Z50S Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Nubia Z50S Pro device. In essence, the Nubia Z50S Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device, providing additional protection. Each [Nubia device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

### What is Nubia Z50S Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nubia Z50S Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nubia Z50S Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nubia Z50S Pro device.

### Purpose of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nubia Z50S Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nubia Z50S Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nubia Z50S Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nubia Z50S Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nubia Z50S Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
