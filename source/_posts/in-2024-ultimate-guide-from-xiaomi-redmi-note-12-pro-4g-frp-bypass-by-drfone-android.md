## Part 1: What Will You Get After Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Xiaomi FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Xiaomi phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Xiaomi phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Xiaomi FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Xiaomi phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

### What is Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
