## Ultimate Guide on Infinix Hot 40i FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Infinix phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Infinix Hot 40i FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Infinix FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Infinix phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Infinix Hot 40i FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Infinix FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Infinix phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Infinix phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Infinix FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Infinix phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

Then are you curious about the safety of the **Pangu FRP bypass tool**? What is this tool, and how does it work? If you have similar questions, this guide has the answers. Here, we'll show you what you need to know about the bypass tool and alternative software.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Infinix Hot 40i device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

![reset android phone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg)

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Infinix Hot 40i device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

## Part 2: What Are the Supported Brands for the Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

The Pangu FRP Bypass boasts extensive compatibility with several Android brands, covering:

## Part 5: Is Pangu FRP Bypass the Best FRP Removal Tool for You?

**Pangu FRP bypass tool** is free and works on older Android versions. But there are reasons to consider other options. Let's explore them.

Technical Knowledge Required

It can be a bit complex to use for some users, especially if you're not tech-savvy. Using it involves downloading and installing APKs, which can be risky and time-consuming. It's not as beginner-friendly as some alternatives in the market.

Limited Customer Support

Thetooldoesn't provide official support via live chat or phone. This leaves you without direct help if issues arise during the bypass process. Depending on online forums for troubleshooting can be time-consuming and unreliable.

Limited Compatibility

**Pangu FRP bypass** is primarily focused on Samsung devices and may not work on the latest Android brands or versions. Also, it needs an OTG cable and USB drive, making it less convenient. Consider FRP bypass alternatives for broader compatibility and ease.

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate

While the bypass tool can sometimes be effective, its success rate isn't guaranteed. It can be frustrating if you go through the entire process only to find it didn't work on your device. Choosing other [<u> FRP bypass software</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/huawei-frp-tools.html) with a higher success rate can save you time.

Choosing between Pangu and an alternative depends on your needs and tech skills. If you're comfortable with downloading APK, Pangu can work. But if you prefer ease of use, broader device compatibility, and safety, consider dedicated tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock (Android).

## Part 6: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock for Android: Best Alternative to Pangu
