FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Nubia phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Nubia Z50S Pro FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Nubia FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Nubia phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Nubia Z50S Pro FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Nubia FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Nubia phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Nubia phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Nubia FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Nubia phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

### What is Nubia Z50S Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nubia Z50S Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nubia Z50S Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nubia Z50S Pro device.

### Purpose of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nubia Z50S Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nubia Z50S Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nubia Z50S Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Nubia Z50S Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nubia Z50S Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nubia Z50S Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Nubia Z50S Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### Common Issues Faced During Bypassing Nubia Z50S Pro FRP

- **Incorrect Google Account Credentials:** One of the most common issues during FRP bypass is entering incorrect Google account credentials. Double-check the email address and password associated with the Nubia Z50S Pro device.
- **Unstable Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is crucial during the FRP bypass process. Ensure your device is connected to the internet throughout the procedure and it is not unstable.
- **Outdated Software:** Using outdated or incompatible tools may result in unsuccessful bypass attempts. Always ensure you are using the latest version of the tool or method.
- **Device Compatibility:** Not all bypass methods are universally compatible with all Android devices. Ensure that the method you choose is intended for use with the Nubia Z50S Pro.

### Tips To Ensure a Successful Bypass Process

1. **Back-Up Data:** Before attempting any bypass method, back up your important data because it will prevent accidental loss during the process.
2. **Verify Official Methods:** Always focus on official methods, such as using Google account credentials. They are better than third-party tools or combination files.
3. **Use Reputable Sources:** If you opt for alternative tools or methods, download them from reputable sources. It will help you avoid malware or security risks.
4. **Read User Reviews:** If using third-party tools, read user reviews and forums. This will help you gauge their effectiveness and safety.
5. **Follow Instructions Carefully:** Whether using official methods or alternative tools, follow instructions diligently to avoid mistakes.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Nubia ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Nubia  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use. Additionally, if you have got a hand on a second-hand device having an FRP lock, then also you would be in trouble accessing the phone.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Nubia  device and its features.
- Once the lock is removed, it will completely de-link from the previous Google account and hence cannot be blocked or traced by the previous owner.
- You can permanently delete the Google account.
