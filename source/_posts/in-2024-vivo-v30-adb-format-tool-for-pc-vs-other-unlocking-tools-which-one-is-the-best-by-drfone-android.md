## Part 3. How to Bypass Google Verification on Vivo Without SwiftKey

There are several APK files available to get this task done like FRP Bypass APK, Pangu FRP bypass, and more. Depending on the model of your device, you can choose a free or a premium version as available.

To bypass FRP lock using this method, you would need an APK file, OTG cable, USB stick, and an internet connection that is stable.

With the above steps, the FRP lock will be bypassed and removed.
