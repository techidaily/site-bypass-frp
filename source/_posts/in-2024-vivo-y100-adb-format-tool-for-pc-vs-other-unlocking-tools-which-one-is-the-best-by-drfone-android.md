### What is Vivo Y100 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y100 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y100 device to the user's Google account.

The primary purpose of Vivo Y100 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y100 device.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Vivo Y100 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Vivo Y100 to your computer.

## Conclusion

The **GSM Flasher ADB Bypasser FRP tool** offers a cost-free and versatile solution to bypass FRP locks on a range of Android devices. While it provides an effective means to unlock your device, you might need to consider its compatibility, potential legal implications, and the learning curve associated with its usage.

As an alternative, tools like Dr.Fone can be explored for additional compatibility and ease of use. And, of course, the choice between these tools depends on your preferences and specific device requirements.
