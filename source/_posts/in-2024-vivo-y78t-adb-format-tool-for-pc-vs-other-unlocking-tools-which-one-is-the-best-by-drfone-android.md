### What is Vivo Y78t FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y78t by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y78t device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y78t device to the user's Google account.

The primary purpose of Vivo Y78t FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y78t device.
