## Pangu FRP Bypass and Best Alternative Tool For your Android Device

**Pangu FRP Bypass** is a popular tool claiming to unlock Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on various Android phones. FRP is automatically enabled when you set up your Android device and link it to a Google account.

The FRP lock activates if someone tries to do a [<u>factory reset</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/unlock-android-screen/) in an untrusted environment without removing the Google account. Without entering your Google credentials, you won't be able to use your phone. It renders your phone useless for resale or personal use.

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

### What is Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Xiaomi Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.
