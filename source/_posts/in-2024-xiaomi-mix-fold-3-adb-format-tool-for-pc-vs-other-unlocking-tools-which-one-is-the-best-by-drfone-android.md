We discussed the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Xiaomi tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Xiaomi smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
