However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 8 Plus after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Infinix Smart 8 Plus is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Infinix Smart 8 Plus and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.
