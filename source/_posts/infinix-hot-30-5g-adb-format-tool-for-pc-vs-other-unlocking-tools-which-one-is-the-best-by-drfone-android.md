## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Infinix Hot 30 5G device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

If you need to factory reset your phone but don't want to lose access to your Google account, it can help you bypass the FRP after the reset.

![reset android phone settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-02.jpg)

How Does It Work?

There are two main versions of **Pangu FRP Bypass tools**:

- **Pangu FRP Bypass APK**

This app is downloaded and installed on the FRP-locked device. It directs you through steps, using weaknesses to reach hidden settings. By doing so, the **Pangu FRP Bypass APK** removes the FRP lock, allowing access to the home screen.

- **Pangu FRP Bypass Tool for PC**

This software runs on your computer and requires connecting your device via USB. It then performs similar operations to the APK version. That is using the computer connection to control the Infinix Hot 30 5G device's system and bypass the FRP lock.

Is It Legal?

The legality of using the **Pangu FRP Bypass** remains a gray area. While it's not inherently illegal, using it for purposes like accessing stolen devices is unlawful. Use it responsibly and ethically.

### What is Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Hot 30 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Hot 30 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Hot 30 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Hot 30 5G device.

### Purpose of Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Hot 30 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Hot 30 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Hot 30 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Hot 30 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Hot 30 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Hot 30 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Infinix Hot 30 5G FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:
