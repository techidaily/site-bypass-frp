This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss.

The fastest and easiest way is to use the **Google FRP code**, which lets you bypass the FRP lock within seconds. You can also use the Talkback method if you have an older Google device. In addition to the FRP lock, you can bypass the screen lock on any Google device with [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/). Dr.Fone enables users to unlock any android device without a password. It is a one-stop solution with features like WhatsApp transfer, data backup and restore, data eraser, and system repair.
