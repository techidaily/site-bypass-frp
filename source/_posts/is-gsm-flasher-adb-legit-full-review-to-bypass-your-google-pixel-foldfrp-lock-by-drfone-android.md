## Part 1: What’s Google Pixel Fold FRP Code and How To Use It

Google smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Google Pixel Fold device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Google Pixel Fold device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Google Pixel Fold device.

The ****Google Pixel Fold FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Google Pixel Fold device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Google Pixel Fold device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Google Pixel Fold device. In essence, the Google Pixel Fold FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Google Pixel Fold device, providing additional protection. Each [Google device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Google Pixel Fold device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Google smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

At this point, the Google Pixel Fold device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Google Pixel Fold device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

## Part 2: Definition of Google Pixel Fold  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
