## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor Magic 6 Lite device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor Magic 6 Lite device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account.
