Learning how to **FRP bypass on Honor Magic 6 Pro** is vital in many ways. For instance, you might want to hard reset your phone to clear data and remove a bug or virus. Or, you may want to remove every bit of information before gifting or selling the phone. Whichever the case, learning how to bypass FRP on Honor Magic 6 Pro is a cakewalk with this 3-minute read. We'll know how to do that with or without a PC.

## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Honor Magic 6 Pro on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Honor Magic 6 Pro device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Honor Magic 6 Pro devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Honor Magic 6 Pro without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Honor Magic 6 Pro, including via YouTube.

Below are the quick steps for Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus:

### Step 1: Dial an emergency number and save it

- 1\. Fire up your locked phone and connect it to a Wi-Fi network.
- 2\. Navigate back to the “Let's go” screen and tap Emergency call. Dial and call 112.
