### What is FRP?

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a safety measure available on Android smartphones. When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.

### How it works?

Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you'll need your phone's Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we'll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

**A simple list of solutions**

To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.

- Retrieve your Google account on another device
- Delete Google account from Settings
- Bypass Honor FRP through PC by using a USB Cable

## Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor X8b .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Honor FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Honor X8b  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Honor X8b  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Honor X8b  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor X8b . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor X8b , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Honor X8b device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor X8b  with your PC by using a USB cable.

Step 7. At the Google search bar, type Settings and then choose the Settings option.

Step 8. If the Swift Key menu appears, choose Got it > Not Now > Back-Up Reset.

Step 9. Now choose the Factory Data Reset option for resetting your device.

Finally, when you switch on your phone again, the FRP lock will not appear, and you’ve got FRP Honor disabled.

## Part 3. How to Bypass Google Verification on Honor Without SwiftKey

If the SwiftKey method is not working for removing the FRP lock, another way is to use the APK tools. There are several APK files available to get this task done like FRP Bypass APK, Pangu FRP bypass, and more. Depending on the model of your device, you can choose a free or a premium version as available.

To bypass FRP lock using this method, you would need an APK file, OTG cable, USB stick, and an internet connection that is stable.

Steps **Honor FRP Bypass Tool** APK

- Step 1. Restart your device and choose Language > English > Next.
- Step 2. Skip the option of Insert SIM card and then connect your Honor X8b to a stable WiFi network.
- Step 3. Transfer the downloaded APK file to the USB drive.
- Step 4. Connect the SUB drive to the Honor X8b device using an OTG cable.
- Step 5. Transfer and install the APK file to your Honor device. During the APK installation process, security certification permission needs to be provided.
- Step 6. After the APK installation is done successfully, access to the phone settings will be provided after which you can find the synced Google Account data and delete the same. Alternatively, you can also delete all the settings of the phone.

With the above steps, the FRP lock will be bypassed and removed.

## Part 4. How to Delete a Google Account on Honor after Factory Reset

Removing the FRP lock can put your device at risk if it lands into unauthorized access, but if you find hassle in remembering the Google Account details and doubt you can easily forget it, removing the associated Google account is better as it will also disable the FRP lock.

Also, if you are selling your phone or gifting it to someone, then remove the associated Google Account so that the new owner does not have any issues with the factory reset of the Honor X8b device.

**Steps for removing the Google Account from Honor Phone**

- Step 1. On the phone home screen, click on the Settings icon and then look for the Passwords & Accounts option.

_**Note: The option can also be looked at Users & accounts section.**_

- Step 2. Click on the Accounts option and the list of the associated and linked accounts will appear.
- Step 3. Select the Google account that you want to delete and then click on the Remove account option.
- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
- With the steps above, the synced account will be deleted and thus the FRP lock will be removed.
