## How Can We Bypass Honor X9a FRP?

After you hard reset your Honor smartphone, you must open the FRP lock before using it. If you can't pass the FRP lock, Google will block your device for privacy and security. You can easily pass the **Honor FRP** lock with your Google account and password. You will get stuck there if you don't know your account and password. Although it seems like a big problem, there is no need to panic because you can bypass it using other methods.

One of the fastest ways to remove the FRP lock is to use the **Honor FRP code**. If you don't want to use this method, you can also use the talkback method to bypass FRP. Both of these methods work perfectly every time, so the choice is up to you. Here, we will give you an easy guide to bypass FRP on your Honor .

## Part 1: What is Honor FRP Bypass Code?

Factory reset protection is a Google security feature that protects your phone from unauthorized access. The FRP activates when you log in with a Google account on your smartphone.

You can enter the **Honor FRP bypass code** to open the FRP lock on your device without your Google account and password.

Even for smartphones from the same brand, the method to bypass FRP varies for each model. Instead of using complex methods to bypass FRP on your device, you can use the bypass code to remove the lock in seconds.
