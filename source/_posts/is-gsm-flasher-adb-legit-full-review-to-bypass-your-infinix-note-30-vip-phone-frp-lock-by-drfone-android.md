### Common Issues and Their Solutions

Before we lead into an assessment of the tips that one can follow to avoid issues with their Infinix FRP bypass process, it is necessary to guide users with the problems involving the process. However, along with the issues, all the required solutions are associated with them.

#### 1\. Faulty USB Connection

**Solution:** Ensure your Infinix device is properly connected to your computer via a USB cable. Moreover, try using a different laptop port or USB cable but confirm it is original to fix any connection-related issues.

#### 2\. Device Compatibility Issue

The FRP bypass tool you are using may not be compatible with your specific Infinix device model or Android version.
