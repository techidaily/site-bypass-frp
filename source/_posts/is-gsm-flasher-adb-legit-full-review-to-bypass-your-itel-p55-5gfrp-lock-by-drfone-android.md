## Part 1: What’s Itel P55 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P55 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P55 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P55 5G device.

The ****Itel P55 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P55 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P55 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P55 5G device. In essence, the Itel P55 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P55 5G device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel P55 5G device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P55 5G device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
