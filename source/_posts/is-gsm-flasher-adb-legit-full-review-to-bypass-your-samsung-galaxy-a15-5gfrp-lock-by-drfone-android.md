Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device.

After a factory reset, the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device.
