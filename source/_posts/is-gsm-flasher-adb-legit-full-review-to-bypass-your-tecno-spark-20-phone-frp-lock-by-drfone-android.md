### What is Tecno Spark 20 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 20 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark 20 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark 20 device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark 20 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark 20 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark 20 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Tecno Spark 20 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Tecno Spark 20 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Tecno Spark 20 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Tecno Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Tecno Spark 20 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Tecno Spark 20 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Tecno Spark 20 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Tecno Spark 20 to the computer.

Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Tecno Spark 20 to your computer.
