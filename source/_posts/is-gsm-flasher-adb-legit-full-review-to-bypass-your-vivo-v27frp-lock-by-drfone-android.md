## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Vivo V27 on Samsung?

Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Vivo V27 device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Vivo V27 devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Vivo V27 without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Vivo V27, including via YouTube.
