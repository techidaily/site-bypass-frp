## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo Y100i FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo Y100i FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo Y100i FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo Y100i:

![bypass Vivo Y100i frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Vivo Y100i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y100i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y100i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y100i device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Vivo Y100i FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y100i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y100i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y100i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y100i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y100i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y100i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y100i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y100i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y100i FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
