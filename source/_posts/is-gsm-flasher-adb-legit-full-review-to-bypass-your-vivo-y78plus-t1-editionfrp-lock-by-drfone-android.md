## Part 1: Is it possible to bypass FRP Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition on Samsung?

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system introduced by Google in 2015 on Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition, including via YouTube.

Below are the quick steps for Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus:
