This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Xiaomi Civi 3:

![bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Civi 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Civi 3 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Civi 3 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Civi 3 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Civi 3 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Civi 3 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
