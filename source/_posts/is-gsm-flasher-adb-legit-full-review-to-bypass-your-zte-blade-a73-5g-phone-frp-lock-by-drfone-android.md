![bypass ZTE Blade A73 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is ZTE Blade A73 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the ZTE Blade A73 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the ZTE Blade A73 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the ZTE Blade A73 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the ZTE Blade A73 5G device.

### Purpose of ZTE Blade A73 5G FRP

The primary purpose of ZTE Blade A73 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the ZTE Blade A73 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the ZTE Blade A73 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the ZTE Blade A73 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
