## Part 1: What’s Google Pixel Fold FRP Code and How To Use It

Google smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Google Pixel Fold device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Google Pixel Fold device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Google Pixel Fold device.

The ****Google Pixel Fold FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Google Pixel Fold device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Google Pixel Fold device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Google Pixel Fold device. In essence, the Google Pixel Fold FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Google Pixel Fold device, providing additional protection. Each [Google device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Google Pixel Fold FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Google FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Google phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Google phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Google FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Google phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._
