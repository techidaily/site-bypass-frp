## Part 1: What’s Honor 90 Lite FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor 90 Lite device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor 90 Lite device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor 90 Lite device.

The ****Honor 90 Lite FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor 90 Lite device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor 90 Lite device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor 90 Lite device. In essence, the Honor 90 Lite FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor 90 Lite device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor 90 Lite device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

## Part 2: How To Bypass Honor 90 Lite FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Honor 90 Lite FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Honor phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Honor 90 Lite FRP:
