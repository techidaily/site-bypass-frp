The primary purpose of Honor Magic V2 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic V2 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic V2 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic V2 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.
