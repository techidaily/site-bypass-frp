## Part 1: What’s Honor Play 40C FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor Play 40C device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor Play 40C device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor Play 40C device.

The ****Honor Play 40C FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor Play 40C device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor Play 40C device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor Play 40C device. In essence, the Honor Play 40C FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor Play 40C device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor Play 40C device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor Play 40C FRP Code

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor Play 40C device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor Play 40C FRP

Honor Play 40C devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor Play 40C device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor Play 40C device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.

## Part 2: Bypass Honor Play 40C FRP With 3 Easy Methods

Bypassing FRP can be a bit tricky, but it's possible to do it if you have the right tools and know-how. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to bypass FRP on your Honor Play 40C device, below are the methods you can use to Honor Play 40C Hot 10 FRP bypass.

### Method #1: Recover the Google Account Of Your Device

You can solve the problem if you have an alternate email address or phone number associated with the account you want to recover. By inserting a verification code, you can easily change the password for your Google account.

After resetting your password, it will take 24 to 72 hours to sync the new password with all devices registered to the account.

Once synced, you can perform a factory data reset by providing an email and a new password. Following this method, you can factory reset your Honor Play 40C Hot S without bypassing FRP.

However, if you provide the wrong password in this process, the time will restart for the next 24-72 hours to sync.

So, be careful when entering your email and password on the Honor Play 40C device.
