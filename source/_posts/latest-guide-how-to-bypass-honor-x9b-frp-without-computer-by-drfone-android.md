## Part 1: What’s Honor X9b FRP Code and How To Use It

Honor smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Honor X9b device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Honor X9b device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Honor X9b device.

The ****Honor X9b FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Honor X9b device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Honor X9b device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Honor X9b device. In essence, the Honor X9b FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Honor X9b device, providing additional protection. Each [Honor device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Honor X9b device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Honor smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Honor X9b FRP Code

To use the Honor X9b FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Honor smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Honor customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Honor model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Honor smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Honor X9b device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Honor X9b device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

## Part 1. Can I Bypass Google Lock on Honor ?

Yes, the Google Lock on Honor  can be bypassed using an FRP bypass tool. Although in case of theft and loss, the FRP lock is a great feature, but on the flip side, in a situation where you forget your Google credentials, the function can be more of a problem than of use.

You can choose between tools without a computer as well as PC-based programs to bypass and remove the Google Account. Once the account is removed using the tools, the following will be the benefits.

- You will have complete access to your Honor  device and its features.

### What is FRP?

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a safety measure available on Android smartphones. When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.

Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you'll need your phone's Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we'll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

## Solutions to Bypass Honor FRP?

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor X9b .
