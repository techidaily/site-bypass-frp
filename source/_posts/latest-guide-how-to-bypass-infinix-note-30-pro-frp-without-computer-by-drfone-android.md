## Part 1: What’s Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Infinix smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Infinix Note 30 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Infinix Note 30 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Infinix Note 30 Pro device.

The ****Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Infinix Note 30 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Infinix Note 30 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security.
