Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

The ****Itel A60 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel A60 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel A60 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel A60 device. In essence, the Itel A60 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.
