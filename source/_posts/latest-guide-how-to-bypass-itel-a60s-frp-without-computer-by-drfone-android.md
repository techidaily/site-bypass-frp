Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel A60s device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel A60s device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel A60s device.

The ****Itel A60s FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel A60s device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel A60s device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel A60s device. In essence, the Itel A60s FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel A60s device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
