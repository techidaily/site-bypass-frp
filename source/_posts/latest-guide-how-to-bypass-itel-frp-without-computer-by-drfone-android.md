## Part 1: What’s Itel P55T FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Itel P55T device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Itel P55T device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P55T device.

The ****Itel P55T FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P55T device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P55T device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P55T device. In essence, the Itel P55T FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Itel P55T device, providing additional protection. Each [Itel device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Itel P55T device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Itel smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Itel P55T FRP Code

To use the Itel P55T FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Itel smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Itel customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Itel model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Itel smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Itel P55T device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P55T device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Itel P55T FRP

Remember that FRP codes can differ based on your Itel smartphone model and software version. Recognizing that using an FRP code obtained from unofficial sources can pose security risks is crucial. To ensure the safety of your device, it is recommended that you get the FRP code from trusted sources.

## How To Bypass Itel P55T FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Itel P55T FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Itel P55T users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Itel P55T FRP

Itel P55T devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel P55T device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
