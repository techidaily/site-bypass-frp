## Am I able to bypass Nubia FRP?

### What is FRP?

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a safety measure available on Android smartphones. When you establish a Google Account on your smartphone, FRP is felt most strongly. When FRP is enabled, it stops a device from being used after a factory data reset unless you log in with a Google identity.

### How it works?

Factory Reset Protection is an enhanced security feature that is accessible on the bulk of Android smartphones. When you reset your Android phone, you'll need your phone's Login details to gain entry to it. But now, we'll go through the free FRP tools that can bypass your Google FRP.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

Requisite: Before attempting this method on your device, ensure that your cellphone has at least a 50-60% rechargeable battery to finish the upgrading process properly.

**A simple list of solutions**

To solve your problem, we have provided these three solutions you can have to unlock your android.

- Retrieve your Google account on another device
- Delete Google account from Settings
- Bypass Nubia FRP through PC by using a USB Cable

## Solutions to Bypass Nubia FRP?

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Nubia FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**
