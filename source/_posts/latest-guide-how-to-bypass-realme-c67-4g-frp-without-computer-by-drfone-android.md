## Part 1: What’s Realme C67 4G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

This security feature is meant to prevent unauthorized Factory Resetting of your phone. In other words, you'll need to enter the correct Google Account details to bypass FRP. Because FRP or Activation Lock is available on Android 5.1 or later, it will automatically activate on your Realme C67 4G device after adding your Gmail account. Some Samsung Realme C67 4G devices include S8, S8 Plus, Note 8, Note 9, J6, J7, M1, and other Galaxy phones launched before 2018.

Meanwhile, you must be asking if it's possible to bypass FRP on Realme C67 4G without a PC? The answer is yes! There are multiple methods to bypass FRP on Realme C67 4G, including via YouTube.
