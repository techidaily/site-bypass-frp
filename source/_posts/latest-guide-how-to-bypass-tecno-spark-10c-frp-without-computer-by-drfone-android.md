![bypass Tecno Spark 10C frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Tecno Spark 10C FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 10C by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 10C device.
