## Part 1: What’s Vivo S18e FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo S18e device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo S18e device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo S18e device.

The ****Vivo S18e FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo S18e device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo S18e device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo S18e device. In essence, the Vivo S18e FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo S18e device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo S18e device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Vivo S18e FRP Code

To use the Vivo S18e FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Vivo smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Vivo smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Vivo S18e device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo S18e device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Vivo S18e FRP
