## Part 1: What’s Vivo S18 FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo S18 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo S18 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo S18 device.
