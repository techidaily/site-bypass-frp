## Part 1: What’s Vivo V29 FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Vivo V29 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo V29 device.

The ****Vivo V29 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo V29 device after it has been reset.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

### Ensuring Device Compatibility

First, verify that your Vivo smartphone is running one of the supported Android versions, specifically Android 11, 12, or 13. This tutorial is specifically tailored to these versions.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Vivo before backing up your data.
