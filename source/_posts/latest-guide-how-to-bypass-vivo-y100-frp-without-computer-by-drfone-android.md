## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y100 FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y100 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo Y100 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y100 device.

The ****Vivo Y100 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y100 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y100 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y100 device. In essence, the Vivo Y100 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo Y100 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Vivo Y100 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Vivo Y100 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Vivo Y100 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Part 2. How to Remove Google FRP Lock on Any Vivo Y100 Phone?

To remove the Google FRP lock on your Vivo Y100 device, you can follow any of the methods discussed below:

### 1\. Bypass Google FRP Lock on Your Vivo Y100 Phone

### 3\. Deactivate FRP in Your Vivo Y100 Phone

Removing the Google FRP lock using a computer is impossible in some instances. Deleting your registered Gmail account from the Vivo Y100 device can help you in these circumstances. The downside of this method is that your device's data will lose protection from Google. Here's how you can delete your Gmail account from the FRP-locked phone:

- Launch the "Settings" app on your Vivo Y100 device.

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Vivo Y100 device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Vivo Y100 device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Vivo Y100 device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.
