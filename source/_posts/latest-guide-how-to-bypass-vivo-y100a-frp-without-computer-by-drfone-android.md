## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y100A FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y100A device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo Y100A device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y100A device.

The ****Vivo Y100A FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y100A device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y100A device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y100A device. In essence, the Vivo Y100A FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo Y100A device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo Y100A device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Vivo Y100A FRP Code

To use the Vivo Y100A FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Vivo smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Vivo customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Vivo model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Vivo smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Vivo Y100A device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo Y100A device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

## Part 2: Definition of Vivo Y100A  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
