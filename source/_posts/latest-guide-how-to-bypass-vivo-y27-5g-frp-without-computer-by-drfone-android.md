## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y27 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y27 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset.
