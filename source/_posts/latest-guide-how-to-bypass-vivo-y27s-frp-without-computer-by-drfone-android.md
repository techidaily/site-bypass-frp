## Part 1: What’s Vivo Y27s FRP Code and How To Use It

Vivo smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Vivo Y27s device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Vivo Y27s device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Vivo Y27s device.

The ****Vivo Y27s FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Vivo Y27s device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Vivo Y27s device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Vivo Y27s device. In essence, the Vivo Y27s FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Vivo Y27s device, providing additional protection. Each [Vivo device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Vivo Y27s device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Vivo smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Vivo Y27s FRP Code

To use the Vivo Y27s FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Vivo smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Vivo smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Vivo Y27s device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo Y27s device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Vivo Y27s FRP

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Vivo Y27s device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Vivo Y27s device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
