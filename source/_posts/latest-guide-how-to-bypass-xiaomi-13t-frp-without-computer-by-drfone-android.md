![bypass Xiaomi 13T frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi 13T FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi 13T by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 13T device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi 13T device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi 13T device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi 13T FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi 13T FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi 13T device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi 13T device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi 13T device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi 13T FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi 13T device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi 13T after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi 13T device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Xiaomi 13T FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:
