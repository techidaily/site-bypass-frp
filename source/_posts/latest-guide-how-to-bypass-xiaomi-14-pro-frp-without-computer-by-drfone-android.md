## Part 1: What’s Xiaomi 14 Pro FRP Code and How To Use It

Xiaomi smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Xiaomi 14 Pro device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Xiaomi 14 Pro device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Xiaomi 14 Pro device.

The ****Xiaomi 14 Pro FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Xiaomi 14 Pro device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Xiaomi 14 Pro device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Xiaomi 14 Pro device. In essence, the Xiaomi 14 Pro FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Each [Xiaomi device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code.
