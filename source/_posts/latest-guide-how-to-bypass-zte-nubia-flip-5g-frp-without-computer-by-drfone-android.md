### What is ZTE Nubia Flip 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device to the user's Google account.

### Purpose of ZTE Nubia Flip 5G FRP

The primary purpose of ZTE Nubia Flip 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G device being lost or stolen.
