## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How To Bypass Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Honor Magic 6 Pro has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Honor Magic 6 Pro. It is designed to safeguard the Honor Magic 6 Pro device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor Magic 6 Pro:

![bypass Honor Magic 6 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor Magic 6 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor Magic 6 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.

### Purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor Magic 6 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor Magic 6 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor Magic 6 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor Magic 6 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor Magic 6 Pro is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Honor Magic 6 Pro FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Honor Magic 6 Pro and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Honor Magic 6 Pro to your computer.

![google frp lock on android device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Pangu FRP Bypass Tool?

FRP is a security feature implemented by Google on Android devices running Lollipop (5.1) and later. It ties your Google account to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device, requiring you to enter the account credentials after a factory data reset. The FRP lock discourages phone theft and protects your data.

**The Pangu FRP Bypass tool** aims to get around the FRP lock. It grants you access to your device without needing the Google account credentials. The tool uses the loopholes or flaws in the security system to gain access and disable FRP.

The tool can be helpful in situations where you:

- **Forgot your Google account credentials**

If you can't remember your Google account password, **Pangu FRP unlocker** can help you [<u>bypass the verification</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/how-to-bypass-google-account-verification-after-reset.html) and access your device.

- **Bought a used phone**

If you purchased a used phone with a previous owner's Google account linked, the Pangu FRP tool can help you remove that account and set up your own.

- **Need to reset your phone but don't want to lose access**

![otg for android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pangu-frp-bypass-08.jpg)

Safety Concerns

Some **Pangu FRP bypass APK** versions have been flagged as potentially containing malware or viruses. While this isn't always the case, it's crucial to be cautious and download the tool from a trusted source.

Low Success Rate
