In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Honor X50i FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor X50i FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor X50i FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor X50i FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor X50i:

### What is Honor X50i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor X50i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor X50i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor X50i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor X50i device.

### Purpose of Honor X50i FRP

The primary purpose of Honor X50i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor X50i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor X50i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor X50i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor X50i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor X50i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor X50i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor X50i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Honor X50i FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Honor Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Honor X50i FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Honor X50i is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 2: Honor X50i FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Honor X50i Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.

The SIM card method is a favored FRP lock bypass approach among Honor X50i users. Here is a comprehensive guide on employing this method to bypass the FRP lock on Honor X50i:

- **Step 1.** To start, turn on your Honor X50i and confirm it is FRP-locked by going up to the screen where it demands Google ID. Afterward, return to the language screen and enter a PIN-locked SIM card into the Honor X50i device.

- **Step 2.** Before inserting the SIM card, ensure at least one contact is saved on the card. It could be any random number, and you can do it by inserting the SIM card into another device. After inserting the SIM card, tap "Emergency," where the Honor X50i device asks you for the PIN of the SIM card.

## Part 1. What is AddROM?

**AddROM** is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

But if you have an Android phone with a version above 9.0, you can try an alternate method explained in this article. Let’s move further to the steps of using AddROM.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device. Therefore, you need an extra Android device for the help purpose. After you arrange the Honor X50i device, you can download AddROM bypass from its official website.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** First, you must ensure you have an active SIM card in your locked device. Once confirmed, put it aside and graph another phone in which you installed the AddROM.

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

![Download and install the HushSMS.apk file.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 3:** After the app is installed, open it and click "**WAP PUSH SL.**" Then enter the phone number of the locked device. Now, In the Message box, type "www.youtube.com/@addROMcom" and click the "**SEND WAP PUSH SL** " button.

![Enter the phone number and YouTube Image name.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-03.png)

**Step 4:** Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner and select "Terms & Privacy Policies."

**Step 5:** After clicking Terms & Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type "**addrom.com/bypass,**" scroll down, and then download the relevant "**Google Account Manager** " (GAM) APK.

![Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png)

**Step 6:** Also, you are supposed to download the " **FRP bypass APK**" file from the list. Once the downloading is finished, install both apps on your device.

**Step 7:** Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner. Click the "**Brower sign-in**" option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.

After a restart, you won't get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.

## Part 3. Does AddROM Really Work?

The success rate of the **AddROM bypass** can only be endorsed from the reviews of previous users. They can tell us if the users successfully bypass the FRP locks with this tool. From anecdotal research, we have discovered that some users could bypass the lock.

However, there were a lot of users who reported that they regained access to their phones. On the contrary, we also discovered that some users complained about the inefficiency of this tool. It was also incompatible with various Android versions.
