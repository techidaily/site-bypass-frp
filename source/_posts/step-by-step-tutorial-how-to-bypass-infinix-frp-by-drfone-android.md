## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus:

![bypass Infinix Smart 8 Plus frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 8 Plus after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

- Step 4. Again, click on the Remove account option to confirm deleting the account.
