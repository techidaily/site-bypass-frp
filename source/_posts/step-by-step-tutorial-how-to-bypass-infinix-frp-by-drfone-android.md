### What is Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 8 Plus FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 8 Plus device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
