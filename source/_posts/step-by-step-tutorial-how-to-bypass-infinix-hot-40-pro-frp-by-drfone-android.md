## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Hot 40 Pro:

![bypass Infinix Hot 40 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Hot 40 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device.

### Purpose of Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Hot 40 Pro FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Hot 40 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## FAQs about Google Lock Bypass

### 1\. Does Factory Reset Remove Google Account?

There may be instances when you require wiping out smartphone data to keep it safe against unauthorized access. Maybe you wish to pass on your device to another user or migrate to a different device. It is important to make sure that all accounts linked to the phone are deleted from the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. It should be understood here that a factory reset will not remove Google or other accounts from the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device. The process restores the default factory settings of the phone that you got at the first purchase.

### 2\. How to Enable Factory Reset Protection?

Enabling the Factory Reset protection feature is a smart way to protect the important data on your phone. However, issues of unethical access in cases of theft or loss are quite prominent. You can enable the FRP functionality by taking the following steps:

- When using a new device, sign in to the phone with your Google account. You can use an existing account or create a new one.
- Set a pattern or password screen lock on your device. It is not advisable to use swipe unlock or leave the phone unlocked at all. If you forget the pattern or password, Google credentials can be used to unlock the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device.

These steps will cause the automatic configuration of the Factory Reset Protection feature. The invader will be prompted to enter the registered Google account credentials on every attempt to access the phone.

## Conclusion

Developments in electronic technology have brought a series of benefits, covering easy access, security, and everything in between. One such feature is the Google Factory Reset Protection to protect your device data against untrusted access. The feature is undoubtedly credible, but there may be situations that require bypassing the FRP lock. For affordable solutions to address the concern on Infinix Hot 40 Pro phones, pick the one that corresponds to your specific situation.
