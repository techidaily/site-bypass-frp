### Purpose of Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Note 30 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Note 30 Pro device being lost or stolen.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Note 30 Pro device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
