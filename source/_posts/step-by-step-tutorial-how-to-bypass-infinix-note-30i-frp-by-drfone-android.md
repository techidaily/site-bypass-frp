## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Note 30i FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Note 30i FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Note 30i FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Note 30i:

![bypass Infinix Note 30i frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Note 30i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Note 30i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Note 30i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Note 30i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Note 30i device.

### Purpose of Infinix Note 30i FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Note 30i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Note 30i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Note 30i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Note 30i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Note 30i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Note 30i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Note 30i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Note 30i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Note 30i FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Infinix Note 30i is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## The Updated Method to Bypass Infinix Note 30i FRP

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Infinix uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Infinix Note 30i device would be able to access the Infinix Note 30i device. This aids in preventing the Infinix Note 30i device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device.
