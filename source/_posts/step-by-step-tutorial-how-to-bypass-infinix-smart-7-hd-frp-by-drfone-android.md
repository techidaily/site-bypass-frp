### What is Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Smart 7 HD by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Smart 7 HD device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Smart 7 HD device.

### Purpose of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Smart 7 HD device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Smart 7 HD device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Smart 7 HD device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Smart 7 HD device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Smart 7 HD after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Smart 7 HD device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Smart 7 HD FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

#### Pros

- Does not require any money
- The fastest and most straightforward process of bypassing
- No involvement of Google account or its credentials

#### Cons

- You need to download the file and install it on your PC

#### Limitations

The major limitation of this process is its dependency on a computer or laptop. Next, you won't be able to reboot your device until and unless you connect it to the PC through the USB cable. Some data can get lost due to the automatic reboot system.

**Tips:**

One of the best ways to bypass FRP lock is to disable it beforehand. To do so, go to your settings and click the accounts option. All the accounts like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Google will open up. Click on Google and remove all the saved and active Google accounts. This will automatically disable the FRP lock.
