It is due to the Infinix Zero 30 5G device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Infinix Zero 30 5G. It is designed to safeguard the Infinix Zero 30 5G device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Infinix Zero 30 5G:

![bypass Infinix Zero 30 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Infinix Zero 30 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Infinix Zero 30 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Infinix Zero 30 5G device.

### Purpose of Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Infinix Zero 30 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Infinix Zero 30 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Infinix Zero 30 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Infinix Zero 30 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Infinix Zero 30 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Infinix Zero 30 5G FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Infinix Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

FRP will be triggered immediately after the Google accounts have been connected to the Android smartphone. If FRP is enabled, the Samsung smartphone cannot be used after a factory reset unless you connect using your Google login and username that you previously made on the Samsung device.

If you want to restore the factory reset on your Android phone, make sure you're in the options, navigate to your Account Settings, head to your accounts and clouds, and remove the Gmail email account on your Android smartphone. This should activate the FRP feature on your Android device.

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Infinix Zero 30 5G .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Infinix FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Infinix Zero 30 5G  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**
