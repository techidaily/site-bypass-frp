### What is Itel A60 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel A60 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel A60 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel A60 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel A60 device.

### Purpose of Itel A60 FRP

The primary purpose of Itel A60 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel A60 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel A60 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel A60 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel A60 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel A60 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel A60 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel A60 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Itel A60 FRP Bypass Without PC Using SIM Card Method

While the software solution is the best option for **Itel A60 Pro FRP bypass,** other options can also feature an unlocking service. These conventional methods are complex; however, they offer a solution to unlocking FRP.
