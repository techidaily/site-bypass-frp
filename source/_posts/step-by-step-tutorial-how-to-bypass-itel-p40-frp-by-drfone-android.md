### What is Itel P40 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P40 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P40 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P40 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P40 device.

### Purpose of Itel P40 FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P40 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P40 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P40 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P40 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P40 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P40 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P40 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P40 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel P40 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process.

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Itel P40 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Itel?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Itel P40 device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Itel smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Itel P40 device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Itel P40 device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Itel P40 device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Itel P40 device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Itel. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Itel P40 device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
