## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How To Bypass Itel P55 FRP

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Itel P55 has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Itel P55 device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Itel P55. It is designed to safeguard the Itel P55 device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Itel P55 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Itel P55 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Itel P55 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Itel P55 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Itel P55:

![bypass Itel P55 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Itel P55 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel P55 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel P55 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel P55 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel P55 device.

### Purpose of Itel P55 FRP

The primary purpose of Itel P55 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel P55 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel P55 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel P55 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Itel P55 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel P55 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel P55 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel P55 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel P55 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Itel P55 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel P55 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Itel P55 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Itel P55 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Itel P55 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.

The ADB and Fastboots command is a workable solution for removing the FRP lock on your Android device, the drawback is that the method is quite complicated and requires thorough technical know-how of ADB and its working. There are several limitations associated with this method as enlisted below.

- **Requires technical know-how**

To remove FRP using the ADB command you need to have a thorough knowledge of using the tool. The tool has a deep learning curve which makes this method little for the majority of the users.

- **Might not unlock the phone**

You can try the ADB method for removing the FRP lock but there is no guarantee that the results will be positive and your device will be unlocked.

- **Issues with the drivers**

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

- **Unexpected issues and errors**

ADB is a command-based method, and thus it is important that the commands are entered right. If there is a slight error in the typing of the command, it might lead to major issues and can even be the Itel P55 device damaged.

- **The process is not user-friendly**

ADB is a technical process aimed toward the geeks, and thus the overall process is not user-friendly and complicated.
