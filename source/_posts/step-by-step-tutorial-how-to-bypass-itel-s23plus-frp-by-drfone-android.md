### What is Itel S23+ FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Itel S23+ by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Itel S23+ device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Itel S23+ device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Itel S23+ device.

### Purpose of Itel S23+ FRP

The primary purpose of Itel S23+ FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Itel S23+ device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Itel S23+ device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Itel S23+ device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Itel S23+ FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Itel S23+ device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Itel S23+ after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Itel S23+ device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Itel S23+ FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Itel Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Itel S23+ is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Itel S23+ FRP

Itel S23+ devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Itel S23+ device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.
