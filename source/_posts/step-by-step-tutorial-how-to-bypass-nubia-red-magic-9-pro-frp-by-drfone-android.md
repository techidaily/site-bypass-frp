![bypass Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device.

### Purpose of Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.
