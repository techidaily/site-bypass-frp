### What is Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 device to the user's Google account.
