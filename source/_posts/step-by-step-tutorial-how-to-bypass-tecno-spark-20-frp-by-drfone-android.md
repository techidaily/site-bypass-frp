This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Tecno Spark 20 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Tecno Spark 20 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Tecno Spark 20 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Tecno Spark 20 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Tecno Spark 20:

![bypass Tecno Spark 20 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Tecno Spark 20 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 20 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark 20 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark 20 device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark 20 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark 20 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark 20 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark 20 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Tecno Spark 20 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Tecno Spark 20 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Tecno Spark 20 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Tecno Spark 20 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Tecno Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Tecno Spark 20 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access.

The feature also protects the Tecno Spark 20 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Tecno Spark 20 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.
