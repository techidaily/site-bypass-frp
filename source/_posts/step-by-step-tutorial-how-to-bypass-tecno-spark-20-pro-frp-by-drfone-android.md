![bypass Tecno Spark 20 Pro frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device.

### Purpose of Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP

The primary purpose of Tecno Spark 20 Pro FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Tecno Spark 20 Pro phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings.

## Part 2: Definition of Tecno Spark 20 Pro  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
