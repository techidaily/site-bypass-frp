### What is Vivo Y200 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y200 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y200 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y200 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y200 device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y200 FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y200 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y200 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y200 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y200 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Vivo Y200 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y200 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y200 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y200 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y200 FRP
