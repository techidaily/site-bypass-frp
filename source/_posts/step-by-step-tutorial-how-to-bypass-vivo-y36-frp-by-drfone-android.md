In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Vivo Y36 FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Vivo Y36 FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Vivo Y36 FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Vivo Y36 FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Vivo Y36:

### What is Vivo Y36 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y36 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y36 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y36 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y36 device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y36 FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y36 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y36 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y36 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y36 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y36 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y36 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y36 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y36 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Vivo Y36 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Vivo Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). By following these steps, you can avoid potential failures:

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Vivo Y36 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Vivo Y36 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Vivo Y36 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Vivo Y36 to the computer.
3. Access to third-party software for bypassing FRP.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Vivo Y36 and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset.

It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Vivo smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Vivo Y36 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Vivo Y36 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### Limitation of Vivo Y36 FRP

## Part 2: How To Bypass Vivo Y36 FRP With Other Methods

Apart from the ****Vivo Y36 FRP bypass code****, other methods are available to bypass the FRP lock. These methods range from using built-in tools within Vivo phones to using third-party software. Given below are three alternative ways to bypass Vivo Y36 FRP:

### Method 1: Using Official Google Account

The FRP lock on your Vivo smartphone is closely linked to the Google account. The whole reason you are facing this situation is that you don't remember your Google account password. It means the FRP lock can be bypassed if you can recover your Google account. To recover your Google account, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** On your computer, use a browser to access the Google Sign-in page. Here, type your Google account email, and when it comes to password, choose "Forget Password."
