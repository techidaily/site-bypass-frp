### What is Vivo Y36i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y36i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y36i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y36i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y36i device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y36i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y36i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y36i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y36i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y36i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y36i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y36i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Definition of Vivo Y36i  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
