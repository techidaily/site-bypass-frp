It is designed to safeguard the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra:

![bypass Xiaomi 14 Ultra frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi 14 Ultra after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi 14 Ultra device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Xiaomi 14 Ultra FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Xiaomi Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

## Part 2: Definition of Xiaomi 14 Ultra  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

## Part 3: Can factory reset really remove FRP?

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
