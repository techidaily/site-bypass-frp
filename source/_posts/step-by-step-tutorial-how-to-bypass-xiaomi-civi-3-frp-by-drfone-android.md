### What is Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Civi 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Civi 3 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Civi 3 device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Civi 3 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Civi 3 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Xiaomi Civi 3 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Xiaomi Civi 3 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Xiaomi Civi 3 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

## Part 2: Preparations Before Bypassing Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the **Xiaomi Y12 FRP bypass**, it's time to prepare for the bypassing process. This section will cover crucial preparations to ensure a successful [FRP bypass](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 1\. Important Notes and Warnings

Before proceeding with the Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP bypass, there are some essential things to keep in mind:

1. **Legal and Ethical Use:** It is crucial to emphasize that bypassing FRP should only be done on devices that you own. Engaging in unauthorized bypassing FRP for illegal purposes may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Warranty Void:** Bypassing FRP may void the warranty of your device. If your Xiaomi Civi 3 is still under warranty, consider contacting the manufacturer or authorized service center for help.
3. **Security Risks:** Bypassing FRP can potentially expose your device to security risks. Only follow trusted guides and sources to avoid installing malicious software.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

1. A desktop computer or laptop with strong internet connectivity.
2. A USB cable to connect your Xiaomi Civi 3 to the computer.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Xiaomi Civi 3 to your computer.

## How To Bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Xiaomi Civi 3 users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Xiaomi Civi 3 device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Xiaomi Civi 3 smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Xiaomi Civi 3 FRP

Xiaomi Civi 3 devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Xiaomi Civi 3 device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Xiaomi Civi 3 device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
