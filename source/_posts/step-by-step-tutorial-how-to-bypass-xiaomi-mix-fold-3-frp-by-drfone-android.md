![bypass Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.
