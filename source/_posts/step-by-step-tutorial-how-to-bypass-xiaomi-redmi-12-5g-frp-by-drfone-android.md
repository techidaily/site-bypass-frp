Having a clear understanding of what exactly Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G:

![bypass Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device.

### Purpose of Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

## Part 2: Definition of Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.

To remove FRP, you must remove all Google accounts from your Pixel phone. After doing so, you can factory reset it to clear all your data. So technically, you need to remove all the accounts, and yes, a factory reset will work.
