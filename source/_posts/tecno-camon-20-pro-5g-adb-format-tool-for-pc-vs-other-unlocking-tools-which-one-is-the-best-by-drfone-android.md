## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device.

Once you have downloaded and installed the **AddROM APK** file, you can follow the steps given below:

**Step 2:** Open your browser and visit the [official website](https://addrom.com/bypass) of AddROM. Scroll down and download the " **HushSMS.apk**" file. Then go to "**My Files**" > "**Downloads** " and find HushSMS.apk to install it.

![Download and install the HushSMS.apk file.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-02.png)

**Step 4:** Wait for a while until the AddROM YouTube channel will automatically open on your locked phone. Click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner and select "Terms & Privacy Policies."

**Step 5:** After clicking Terms & Privacy Policies, a browser page will be opened. Click the search bar to type. Here, type "**addrom.com/bypass,**" scroll down, and then download the relevant "**Google Account Manager** " (GAM) APK.

![Download the relevant Google Account Manager APK.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/addrom-bypass-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-04.png)

**Step 7:** Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner. Click the "**Brower sign-in**" option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.
