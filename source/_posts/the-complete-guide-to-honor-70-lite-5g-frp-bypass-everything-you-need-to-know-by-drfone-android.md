## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor 70 Lite 5G device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor 70 Lite 5G device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## Part 1: Understanding the Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Honor 70 Lite 5G:

![bypass Honor 70 Lite 5G frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor 70 Lite 5G by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

### Purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

The primary purpose of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor 70 Lite 5G device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Methods of Honor 70 Lite 5G FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor 70 Lite 5G device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor 70 Lite 5G after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor 70 Lite 5G device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### Working of FRP

The primary purpose of FRP is to prevent unauthorized access to a device after it has been factory reset. It acts as a safeguard against theft or misuse of personal data. Moreover, FRP ensures only the original owner can access the Honor 70 Lite 5G device data and applications. When FRP is enabled on an Android, it becomes tied to the Google account that was previously used on the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

After a factory reset, the Honor 70 Lite 5G device will need the user to enter the Google account credentials. It is the same account associated with the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. This prevents someone who doesn't know the account details from gaining access to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device.

### Significance of FRP

FRP plays a crucial role in protecting personal data stored on Android devices. It acts as a strong deterrent against unauthorized access. This ensures that the data remains inaccessible even if a device falls into the wrong hands. This security measure is particularly important in cases of device theft or loss. It helps prevent sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

By implementing FRP, Google aims to enhance the overall security of Android devices. This also greatly helps in protecting user privacy. It adds an additional layer of protection for your device. FRP makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to bypass the Honor 70 Lite 5G device's security measures.

### Backup Important Data

Backing up data can be possible even in this case; however, you should not have factory reset your Honor before backing up your data. This is because the FRP lock gets enabled after factory resetting the Honor 70 Lite 5G device. While using your Honor with a Google account logged in, you will have to take the services of a third-party tool.

Wondershare Dr.Fone – Phone Backup turns out to be an assistance in this case. The service can be utilized to back up all necessary data before the FRP lock is removed from the Vivo.

### Charging the Honor 70 Lite 5G device Adequately

Ensure that your phone has enough charge to avoid any complications during the FRP bypass process. It is recommended to charge your Honor device to at least 50%.
