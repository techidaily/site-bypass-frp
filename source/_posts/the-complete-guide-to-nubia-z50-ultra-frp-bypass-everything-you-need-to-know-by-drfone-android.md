## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Nubia?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Nubia Z50 Ultra device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Nubia smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Nubia Z50 Ultra device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Nubia Z50 Ultra device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Nubia Z50 Ultra device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Nubia Z50 Ultra device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Nubia. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Nubia Z50 Ultra device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Nubia Z50 Ultra device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Nubia Z50 Ultra device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
