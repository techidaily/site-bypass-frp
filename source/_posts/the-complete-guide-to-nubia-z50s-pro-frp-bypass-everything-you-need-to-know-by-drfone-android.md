Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Nubia Z50S Pro device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Nubia smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Nubia Z50S Pro device and the system.

It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Nubia Z50S Pro device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Nubia Z50S Pro device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Nubia. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Nubia Z50S Pro device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

## Part 2: Definition of Nubia Z50S Pro  FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) includes security on Android gadgets with OS Version 5.1 and higher. The FRP gives an underlying security highlight you can utilize that safeguards your gadget and data, including screen locks and data encryptions. The FRP automatically works once a Google account has been logged in on the phone. However, it will stop working when the Google account is removed from the Pixel phone preceding the Factory Data Reset. When the FRP has been enacted, it will not let others use your phone after a Factory Reset in an untrusted environment. It implies that the FRP Lock will come into play if your Pixel gets Factory Reset in an unrecognized way.
