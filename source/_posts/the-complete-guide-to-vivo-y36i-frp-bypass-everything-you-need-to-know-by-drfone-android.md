## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Vivo?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Vivo Y36i device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Vivo smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Vivo Y36i device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Vivo Y36i device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Vivo Y36i device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Vivo Y36i device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Vivo. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Vivo Y36i device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

For example, if you forget the Google account credentials, you won't be allowed to access a device due to the activation of the FRP lock.

That's why it's better to use the bypassing concept of FRP lock in your Vivo phone. The following section will introduce you to the best and result-oriented methods for bypassing the Google lock and paving the way for unrestricted access to the Vivo Y36i device and system.

### What is Vivo Y36i FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y36i by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y36i device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y36i device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y36i device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y36i FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y36i device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y36i device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y36i device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y36i FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y36i device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y36i after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y36i device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
