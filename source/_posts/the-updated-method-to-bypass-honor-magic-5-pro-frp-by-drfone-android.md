## Part 1: What is FRP lock on Honor?

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Honor Magic 5 Pro device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Honor smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Honor Magic 5 Pro device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Honor Magic 5 Pro device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Honor Magic 5 Pro device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Honor Magic 5 Pro device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Honor. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Honor Magic 5 Pro device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.

That's why it's better to use the bypassing concept of FRP lock in your Honor phone. The following section will introduce you to the best and result-oriented methods for bypassing the Google lock and paving the way for unrestricted access to the Honor Magic 5 Pro device and system.
