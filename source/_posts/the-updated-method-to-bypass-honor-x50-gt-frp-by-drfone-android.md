[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Honor uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Honor X50 GT device would be able to access the Honor X50 GT device. This aids in preventing the Honor X50 GT device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Honor X50 GT devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements.

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor X50 GT FRP bypass.
