## The Updated Method to Bypass Itel P55T FRP

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Itel uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Itel P55T device would be able to access the Itel P55T device. This aids in preventing the Itel P55T device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Itel P55T devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Itel P55T FRP** challenges with our complete method.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Itel P55T FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Itel FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Itel phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Itel phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Itel FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Itel phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._
