## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Itel P40 Devices

Technological advancements in the IT and telecommunication industry simplify your tasks and provide security against cyber malpractices.

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Itel P40 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Itel P40 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Itel P40 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we have explored various methods for ****Itel P40 FRP bypass without a PC****. We discussed the Itel P40 FRP code method, followed by three alternative techniques. These included built-in Itel tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Itel smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Itel P40 FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Itel P40 FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
