## Part 1: What’s Itel P55 FRP Code and How To Use It

Itel smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code.

To regain full access to the Itel P55 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Itel P55 device.

The ****Itel P55 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Itel P55 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Itel P55 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Itel P55 device. In essence, the Itel P55 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Itel P55 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
