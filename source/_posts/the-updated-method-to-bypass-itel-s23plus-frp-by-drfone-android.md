Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Itel uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Itel S23+ device would be able to access the Itel S23+ device. This aids in preventing the Itel S23+ device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Itel S23+ devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Itel S23+ FRP** challenges with our complete method.

We have included more than two ways to unlock your mobile without any hassle and complication. Just follow this guide, and you will regain access to your device in no time.
