Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss.

This aids in preventing the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.

## AddROM Bypass: An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G

Are you an Android user? Have you reset your device and are now stuck at the Google FRP lock screen? If yes, you are not the only one who got into this scenario.

Many Android users need to reset their devices for any reason. But they don't know that their devices are now protected with the new security feature called FRP. This lock requires Google credentials Image nameed to your locked device to access it.

However, in most cases, users don't remember their Google ID and password. This is where ****AddROM** Bypass** steps in to help. This article will explore how you can use AddROM to unlock the FRP lock.

But before starting, let’s learn about **AddROM**!

## Part 1. What is AddROM?

**AddROM** is a special tool designed to bypass the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock. This tool comes in various versions. Each version supports its relevant Android device.

However, the good thing about this tool is that you don't need any PC or laptop to act. All you are supposed to do is download and install the **AddROM APK** file on your Android phone. After that, you can bypass the FRP lock in just a few minutes.

## Part 2. How to Download and Use AddROM APK?

You must be wondering how to download the **AddROM bypass** on an already-locked device. Well, you cannot download it on a locked device.

**Step 7:** Open the FRP bypass APK app and click the "**Menu**" icon at the top right corner. Click the "**Brower sign-in**" option and sign in with the Google account you want. Then, restart your Android device.

After a restart, you won't get to see the FRP lock again. It will be successfully removed. However, most users find this method very complex, and the success rate is also not guaranteed.
