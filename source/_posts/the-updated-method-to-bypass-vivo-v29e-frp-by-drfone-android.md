These included built-in Vivo tools, an official Google account, and Wondershare Dr.Fone. These methods provide viable options for Vivo smartphone users locked out of their devices.

Each method has its own merits and limitations. However, we recommend considering Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) as the best choice for bypassing Vivo V29e FRP. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a trusted and reliable Vivo V29e FRP bypass tool. It offers extensive device compatibility and reliable FRP bypass capabilities.
