## The Updated Method to Bypass Vivo X100 FRP

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Android smartphones have a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that shields user data from theft or loss. Like other manufacturers, Vivo uses FRP as a security feature to make sure that, in the event of a factory reset, only the original owner with the Google account credentials linked with the Vivo X100 device would be able to access the Vivo X100 device. This aids in preventing the Vivo X100 device's theft or unauthorized use.

FRP, however, can also be a problem if a user forgets their Google account login information or loses access to their device. Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Vivo X100 devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle. Say goodbye to **FRP Xiaomi** and **Vivo X100 FRP** challenges with our complete method.
