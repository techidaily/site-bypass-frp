Our step-by-step method will walk you through the most effective ways to bypass FRP on Vivo Y27s devices in 2023, ensuring you can regain access to your device without any hassle.

### What is Vivo Y27s FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Vivo Y27s by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Vivo Y27s device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Vivo Y27s device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Vivo Y27s device.

### Purpose of Vivo Y27s FRP

The primary purpose of Vivo Y27s FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Vivo Y27s device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Vivo Y27s device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Vivo Y27s device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Vivo Y27s FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Vivo Y27s device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Vivo Y27s after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Vivo Y27s device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 3\. Backup Your Data

If you have recently bought a used Vivo Y27s and don't know the Google account credentials, it can trigger FRP on factory reset. Before factory resetting your device, it is essential to back up the data. Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Vivo Y27s to your computer.
