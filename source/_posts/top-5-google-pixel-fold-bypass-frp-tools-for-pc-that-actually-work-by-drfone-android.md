## Step-by-Step Tutorial: How To Bypass Google Pixel Fold FRP

Smartphones are now integral to people's daily lives. In recent days Google Pixel Fold has gained immense popularity. It is due to the Google Pixel Fold device's impressive features and affordability. The rising cybercrimes have forced manufacturers to increase measures for device security. One such security feature is the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) on the Google Pixel Fold. It is designed to safeguard the Google Pixel Fold device from unauthorized access.

While this feature has its advantages, it can pose a significant challenge when users. This is especially the case when they need to perform a factory reset but have forgotten their Google account credentials. In this comprehensive tutorial for 2023, we will guide you step by step on how to bypass the **Google Pixel Fold FRP**.

## Part 1: Understanding the Google Pixel Fold FRP

Having a clear understanding of what exactly Google Pixel Fold FRP entails is important. It will make the process of the **Google Pixel Fold FRP bypass** easier and hassle-free. In this section, we will explore the concept of FRP, its purpose, and how it is activated on the Google Pixel Fold:

![bypass Google Pixel Fold frp lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/vivo-y20-frp-lock-1.jpg)

### What is Google Pixel Fold FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Google Pixel Fold by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Google Pixel Fold device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Google Pixel Fold device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Google Pixel Fold device.

### Purpose of Google Pixel Fold FRP

The primary purpose of Google Pixel Fold FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Google Pixel Fold device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Google Pixel Fold device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Google Pixel Fold device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Google Pixel Fold FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Google Pixel Fold device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Google Pixel Fold after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Google Pixel Fold device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
