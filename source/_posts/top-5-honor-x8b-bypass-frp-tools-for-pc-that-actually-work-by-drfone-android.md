## How To Bypass Honor X8b FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Honor X8b FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Honor X8b users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Honor X8b device and use the same Gmail account.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor X8b FRP

Honor X8b devices are often bypassed for the following reasons:

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor X8b device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor X8b device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
