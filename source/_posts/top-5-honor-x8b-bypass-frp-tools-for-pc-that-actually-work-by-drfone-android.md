Since many Honor X8b users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Honor X8b device and use the same Gmail account.

To unlock the Honor X8b smart 5 FRP, you must use any bypassing tool or method. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of bypassing Honor X8b FRP. So read on for instructions on how to get the job done.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: Some Common Reasons To Bypass Honor X8b FRP

### 1\. Forgotten Google Account Credentials

One of the most common reasons for needing to bypass FRP is that you simply forgot your Google account login credentials. Whether you have a new phone and are setting it up for the first time, or you've had the same phone for a while and are just now adding a Google account, there's always a chance that you might forget your password.

### 2\. A Second-Hand Phone

Another common reason for wanting to bypass FRP is if you've purchased a second-hand phone. If the previous owner of the phone didn't correctly remove their Google account from the Honor X8b device before selling it to you, then you'll be stuck with their account on the phone and won't be able to use it yourself until you bypass FRP.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Honor X8b device again. It is because a factory reset will also remove your Google account from the phone, leaving you locked out unless you can remember the login credentials.
