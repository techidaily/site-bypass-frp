## How To Bypass Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP In 3 Different Ways

Are you having trouble bypassing Infinix Note 30 Pro FRP? If so, you're not alone. A lot of people are struggling with this particular task. But don't worry - We are here to help.

Since many Infinix Note 30 Pro users do not need to log in more than once, they commonly forget their Google email and password.

If you have used this device for an extended period, you might have forgotten the password. A factory reset requires you to log in to your Infinix Note 30 Pro device and use the same Gmail account.

### 3\. Factory Reset In An Untrusted Environment

If you've performed a factory reset on your phone to try and fix an issue or start fresh, you'll need to bypass FRP to use the Infinix Note 30 Pro device again.
