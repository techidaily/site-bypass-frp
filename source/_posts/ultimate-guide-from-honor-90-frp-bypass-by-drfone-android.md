FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Honor phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Honor 90 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Honor FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor 90 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Honor FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 2: How to Bypass Google FRP on Honor Android 11 without PC

## 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 90 FRP

Google Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a FRP, is developed by Google for all Android phones. It adds an extra layer of security to your phone and the data on it. It is aimed at making it difficult for the illegal holder of your phone to factory reset your phone and remove tracking information. Then why do we need to discuss the Honor 90 FRP bypass?

Though the protection is meant for you, sometimes you may forget the password and want your Honor 90 FRP removed. Also, if you bought a used phone and the previous user has set up FRP with her password, you need to bypass it.

## Part 1: In what cases does the Honor 90 FRP bypass works?

### 1\. Buy a locked second-hand Honor

When you buy a second-hand phone, ideally, the previous user must format and hard reset the Honor phone to remove all locks and password requirements. However, if it doesn't happen, you cannot use some options on your phone and configure security because of FRP. Here, your savior is the option of the Honor 90 FRP bypass.

### 2\. Forget Google account ID and password

Even if you have locked your Honor phone yourself, you are stuck when you forget your Google username and password. So, you can only recover your phone using the Honor 90 FRP bypass.
