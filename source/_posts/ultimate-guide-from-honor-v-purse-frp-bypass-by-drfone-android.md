## Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor V Purse FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Honor FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

### What is Honor V Purse FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Honor V Purse by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Honor V Purse device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Honor V Purse device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Honor V Purse device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Purpose of Honor V Purse FRP

The primary purpose of Honor V Purse FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Honor V Purse device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Honor V Purse device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Honor V Purse device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Honor V Purse FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Honor V Purse device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Honor V Purse after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Honor V Purse device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.
