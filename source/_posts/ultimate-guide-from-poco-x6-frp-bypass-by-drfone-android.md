## Part 1: What Will You Get After Poco X6 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Poco FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Poco phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Poco phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Poco FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Poco phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## Part 1: What’s Poco X6 FRP Code and How To Use It

Poco smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Poco X6 device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Poco X6 device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Poco X6 device.

The ****Poco X6 FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Poco X6 device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Poco X6 device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Poco X6 device. In essence, the Poco X6 FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Poco X6 device, providing additional protection. Each [Poco device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Poco X6 device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Poco smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Poco X6 FRP Code

To use the Poco X6 FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Poco smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Poco customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Poco model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Poco smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Poco X6 device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Poco X6 device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.

### What is Poco X6 FRP?

FRP, or Factory Reset Protection, is a security feature integrated into Android devices. It is also included on the Poco X6 by Google to prevent unauthorized access to the Poco X6 device. When FRP is activated on a smartphone, it links the Poco X6 device to the user's Google account.

That makes it mandatory to verify the account credentials after performing a hard reset. In other words, FRP acts as a protective barrier. It ensures only the rightful owner can access the Poco X6 device.

### Purpose of Poco X6 FRP

The primary purpose of Poco X6 FRP is to safeguard personal data and sensitive information stored on the Poco X6 device. It works as an important security measure in the unfortunate event of the Poco X6 device being lost or stolen. FRP ensures that no unauthorized individual can gain access to the Poco X6 device's contents. It does that by requiring the original owner's Google account login details.

By requiring the user's Google account credentials, FRP reduces the chances of device misuse. Thus, it ultimately enhances the data security and privacy of your device.

### Activation Methods of Poco X6 FRP

When you register a Google account on your device, the FRP gets activated automatically. If you remove the Google account from the Poco X6 device before performing a factory data reset, the FRP will be disabled. However, once the FRP is enabled, it will stop you from using your Poco X6 after a factory data reset in an untrusted environment.

In simple words, any other way to factory reset the Poco X6 device except factory reset through settings will trigger FRP lock. A command example of this is a hard factory reset which usually enables FRP lock after the process.

### 2\. Required Tools and Equipment

To bypass Poco X6 FRP, you will need the following tools and equipment:

Since the Google account on your device doesn't belong to you, you will need to use third-party tools to create local backups.

The best tool in this scenario to use is [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). With the help of this tool, you can back up the entire data of your Poco X6 to your computer.
