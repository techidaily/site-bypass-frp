## Ultimate Guide on Xiaomi Redmi A2 FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Xiaomi phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Xiaomi Redmi A2 FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Xiaomi FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Xiaomi phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Xiaomi Redmi A2 FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Xiaomi FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Xiaomi phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Xiaomi phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Xiaomi FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Xiaomi phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

## How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Xiaomi Redmi A2 Devices

The advantages are numerous and appealing, but there are downsides too. One such inconvenience is caused by Google FRP lock in Xiaomi Redmi A2 smartphones.

![google frp bypass in oneplus phones](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-any-oneplus-phones-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is Google FRP and How Does It Work?

Google Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is an in-built security function in Android 5.1 and later versions. The feature protects these devices against intentional data loss on unauthorized access. The utility does not allow a factory reset of your device in case it is lost or stolen. Your data is hence, safe from unwanted mishandling. The feature also protects the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device's data encryptions and screen locks. The functionality gets enabled when you register a Google account on your Android device. As is obvious, the feature gets disabled when the Google account is removed before beginning the Factory Data Reset process.

If your device is under untrusted access and the FRP lock is enabled, the latter will prevent the factory reset of your phone. It is because; the active FRP lock requires entering the Google account credentials registered with the Xiaomi Redmi A2 device. Therefore, unwanted users will not be possible to factory reset the Xiaomi Redmi A2 phone. However, there may be instances when you need to factory reset your FRP-enabled device to its default settings. Ensure that the registered Google account credentials are available to you under such circumstances.
