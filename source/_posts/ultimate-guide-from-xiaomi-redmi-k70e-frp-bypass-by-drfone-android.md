## Part 1: What Will You Get After Xiaomi Redmi K70E FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Xiaomi FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Xiaomi phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Xiaomi phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Xiaomi FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Xiaomi phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

Almost all smartphones come with multiple built-in security and protection features to ensure no 3<sup>rd</sup> party operator or tool can access the data stored in the system memory or the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device. However, if someone initiates the factory reset in your Xiaomi smartphone, the person will easily access everything in the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device and the system.

This is where the FRP or factory reset protection program comes in. It is a built-in safety feature in smartphones that lock the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device as soon as a factory reset is initiated or the user does not enter valid credentials for the Google account. Once the lock is activated, deactivation is very difficult, and it requires the credentials to access the system once again.

As a result, the user cannot restore the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device to its default mode through a factory reset and wipe every data from both system and device memory. The FRP program has proven beneficial for optimal data protection from piracy and unauthorized access. This way, even if you lose your phone or it gets stolen, no one will be able to initiate the reset program to wipe everything from the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device.

The FRP program is not available on all smartphones from Xiaomi. Suppose you want to check whether it is compatible with your smartphone model, open settings from your phone, and go to the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device information section. There, you will be able to see the factory reset option.
