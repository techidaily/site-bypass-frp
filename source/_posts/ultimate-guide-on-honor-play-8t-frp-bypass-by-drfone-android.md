## Ultimate Guide on Honor Play 8T FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Honor phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Honor Play 8T FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Honor FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Honor phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Honor Play 8T FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Honor FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Honor phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Honor phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Honor FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Honor phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

### Retrieve your Google account on another device

The fundamental and most innovative way to do the Factory Reset is to recover a Google account. You can restore your Email ID or password from another device or computer before attempting FRP bypassing Honor Play 8T .

You may also include an alternate email or phone number for the account you would like to restore. Google will email you a verification **Honor FRP bypass code,** which you can use to create a new password for your Google account.

Once you change your password, it will require 24 to 72 hours for the reset password to synchronize with all gadgets connected to the account. After you've synced, you may do a factory data reset by entering your email address and a new password. You may factory reset your device by using this approach.

If you enter the incorrect password throughout this procedure, the time will be reset for the following 24-72 hours to synchronize. So, use caution while putting your email and password into the gadget. To finish the process, link your Honor Play 8T  to a connection and leave it on for the moment.

**Delete Google account from Settings**

Whenever we erase the Google account from the C11, we disable the FRP of the computer system Android 11, Realme. However, it is a prevention that ties the Honor Play 8T  to a Google account such that when it is restarted or prohibited due to loss or theft; it asks for the Google account login and password.

**First step:**

To remove your Google account, navigate to the settings icon on your Realme, which should be on the home screen or in the phone menu. You can reach the main menu by moving your fingertip from the bottom to the top of your screen.

**Second step:**

We browse through the C11 options and seek for the "Accounts" area, where you have to click to enable.

**Third step:**

All accounts associated with this Honor Play 8T  will be displayed, including Google accounts and other social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, etc. Choose the profile you wish to disconnect from this device.

**Fourth step:**

It will show the data associated with this Google account and the Honor Play 8T . To proceed, click "Remove account."

**Fifth step:**

To avoid accidentally disconnecting an account from the Honor Play 8T , tap "Remove account" once more to verify. It will clear the Honor Play 8T device of any data associated with this account.

**Bypass Honor FRP through PC by Using USB Cable**

If you want to use your PC to bypass Honor FRP, then here is another useful solution with the following steps:

**Step 1:**

The first step is to download and install a tool called “SideSync apk.” Once it is installed, run and connect your Honor Play 8T  with your PC by using a USB cable.

**Step 2:**

A pop-up screen will be shown asking you what Application you would like to use for opening the tool. Here you can select Chrome to open this too.
