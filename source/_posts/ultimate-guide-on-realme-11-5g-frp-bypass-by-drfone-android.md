## Ultimate Guide on Realme 11 5G FRP Bypass

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is an Activation Lock system for preventing unauthorized Factory Resetting on your Realme phone. But if you forget your Google Account credentials, you might want to learn a few **Realme 11 5G FRP** **bypass** techniques. So this 3-minute read discusses the most effective **Realme FRP bypass** methods. Note that these methods apply to all Realme phone models, including Spark, Comon, Pop, etc.

## Part 1: What Will You Get After Realme 11 5G FRP Bypass Android 11?

FRP is a mandatory security system embedded in Android 5.1 (Lollipop) or newer. But there are many reasons why you may want to bypass **Realme FRP**. Here are some of them:

#### You’re the new owner and get whole control of your Realme phone

Did your cousin or parent send you their Realme phone but forget to Factory Reset it? If that person is living far from you, that can be a real challenge. So, unless they give you their Gmail credentials, you might be stuck and unable to use the phone. If you bypass FRP, you’ll reset the phone and restore it to its brand-new state.

#### Remove viruses and malware

Although uncommon, your Android phone can start malfunctioning due to a virus or malware infection. You can get these unwanted programs from unknown email attachments, file downloads, website links, etc. So, because merely deleting these files won’t resolve the issue, you’ll need to bypass Realme FRP to Factory Reset the phone and erase everything. Fortunately, you don’t need a phone technician to help you with that.

#### Increase the resale value

Sometimes you may need to do away with your old Realme phone after purchasing a brand-new one. So, instead of keeping or gifting it out, you can sell it and recoup a few coins. Unfortunately, most buyers will want the phone in its brand-new state so that they can install their own apps, add music, movies, etc. If you don’t Factory Reset the phone, your bargaining power also reduces. I’m sure you don’t want that.

_**Important note**: Bypassing FRP is absolutely legal and easy too. But some users may look to bypass FRP on a stolen phone. That’s why we clarify that this post is strictly for educational purposes. Get the consent of the original owner of the phone before bypassing FRP._

Several times while using this method, you might encounter driver issues when your device is not detected as proper drivers are not installed.

## Part 1: What’s Realme 11 5G FRP Code and How To Use It

Realme smartphones incorporate a security measure called the FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is also called a bypass or Google account verification code. This feature is implemented to safeguard the Realme 11 5G device from unauthorized access. The code usually activates following a factory reset. To regain full access to the Realme 11 5G device, users are required to input the Google account credentials associated with the Realme 11 5G device.

The ****Realme 11 5G FRP code**** serves as a protective barrier. It prevents unauthorized individuals from utilizing the Realme 11 5G device after it has been reset. By requesting the Google account credentials tied to the Realme 11 5G device, it acts as an extra layer of security. This ensures that only authorized users can access and operate the Realme 11 5G device. In essence, the Realme 11 5G FRP code is an integral security feature that reinforces user authentication.

It prevents unauthorized access to the Realme 11 5G device, providing additional protection. Each [Realme device](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/vivo-screen-lock.html) possesses a distinct FRP (Factory Reset Protection) code. It is linked to the Google account that was previously synchronized with the Realme 11 5G device. It activates when you perform a factory reset on your Realme smartphone without signing out of the associated Google account.

### Usage of Realme 11 5G FRP Code

To use the Realme 11 5G FRP code effectively on your FRP-locked Realme smartphone, follow these simplified steps:

#### Get the FRP Code

There are a few methods to get the FRP code. You can reach out to Realme customer support for help and guidance. They can help you obtain the specific FRP code for your Realme model. You can also search online to find reliable sources that share FRP codes. Several online platforms and forums cater to users sharing FRP codes. It ensures you find the appropriate code for your device.

#### Enter the FRP Code

Once you have obtained the FRP code, such as \*#812#, power on your Realme smartphone and proceed through the initial setup steps until you encounter the FRP lock screen. At this point, the Realme 11 5G device prompts you to enter your Google account credentials. However, enter the FRP code you obtained instead of inputting your credentials. Typically, the FRP code comprises a numeric sequence specific to your device.

#### Complete the Setup

After entering the FRP code, the Realme 11 5G device undergoes a verification process. It will authenticate the code and unlock the FRP lock. Once the authentication is successful, you can proceed with the setup process. This includes signing in with your Google account or creating a new one.
